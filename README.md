## 118. Supervised learning in DNA neural networks

**Authors:** Kevin M. Cherry, Lulu Qian

**Venue:** Nature

**Publication Date:** September 03, 2025

**Pages:** 1-9

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-025-09479-w

**Abstract:**
Learning enables biological organisms to begin life simple yet develop immensely diverse and complex behaviours. Understanding learning principles in engineered molecular systems could enable us to endow non-living physical systems with similar capabilities. Inspired by how the brain processes information, the principles of neural computation have been developed over the past 80 years1, forming the foundation of modern machine learning. More than four decades ago, connections between neural computation and physical systems were established2. More recently, synthetic molecular systems, including nucleic acid and protein circuits, have been investigated for their abilities to implement neural computation3–7. However, in these systems, learning of molecular parameters such as concentrations and reaction rates was performed in silico to generate desired input–output functions. Here we show that DNA molecules can be programmed to autonomously carry out supervised learning in vitro, with the system learning to perform pattern classification from molecular examples of inputs and desired responses. We demonstrate a DNA neural network trained to classify three different sets of 100-bit patterns, integrating training data directly into memories of molecular concentrations and using these memories to process subsequent test data. Our work suggests that molecular circuits can learn tasks more complex than simple adaptive behaviours. This opens the door to molecular machines capable of embedded learning and decision-making in a wide range of physical systems, from biomedicine to soft materials.

## 115. Electron flow matching for generative reaction mechanism prediction

**Authors:** Joonyoung F. Joung, Mun Hong Fong, Nicholas Casetti, Jordan P. Liles, Ne S. Dassanayake, Connor W. Coley

**Venue:** Nature

**Publication Date:** September 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 645, Issue 8079

**Pages:** 115-123

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-025-09426-9

**Abstract:**
Central to our understanding of chemical reactivity is the principle of mass conservation1, which is fundamental for ensuring physical consistency, balancing equations and guiding reaction design. However, data-driven computational models2–9 for tasks such as reaction product prediction rarely abide by this most basic constraint10–13. Here we recast the problem of reaction prediction as a problem of electron redistribution using the modern deep generative framework of flow matching14–16, explicitly conserving both mass and electrons through the bond-electron (BE) matrix representation17,18. Our model, FlowER, overcomes limitations inherent in previous approaches by enforcing exact mass conservation, resolving hallucinatory failure modes, recovering mechanistic reaction sequences for unseen substrate scaffolds and generalizing effectively to out-of-domain reaction classes with extremely data-efficient fine-tuning. FlowER also enables downstream estimation of thermodynamic or kinetic feasibility and manifests a degree of chemical intuition in reaction prediction tasks. This inherently interpretable framework represents an important step in bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and mechanistic understanding in data-driven reaction outcome prediction.

## 114. Generalizable descriptors for automatic titanium alloys design by learning from texts via large language model

**Authors:** Ping Wang, Yuan Jiang, Weijie Liao, Rong Wang, Minjie Lai, Hongchao Kou, Xiubing Liang, Jinshan Li, Turab Lookman, Ruihao Yuan

**Venue:** Acta Materialia

**Publication Date:** September 01, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 296

**Pages:** 121275

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.actamat.2025.121275

**Abstract:**
Descriptors are essential prerequisites for the success of machine learning-based materials design. However, the automatic construction of generalizable descriptors for various properties, together with their integration with design criteria, remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we overcome this obstacle by devising a framework that integrates large language model, domain theory constraints ([Mo]eq and d-electron theory), and multi-objective global optimization. This framework fuses structured (tabular composition/processing) and unstructured (texts) data to obtain enriched descriptors and facilitate materials design. Using titanium alloys as model case, we first automatically achieve descriptors that generalize well across a variety of properties for optimized prediction models. With which a design pipeline is proposed, several alloys with high promise for enhanced competing properties are identified from a vast chemical and processing space, and their reliability is validated via experimental synthesis. It is revealed that the enriched descriptors, learned from ∼ 50,000 texts without apparent physics, capture expertise related to phase stability, alloying rules for specific properties, and more. Our proposed approach can be applied to the design of other materials where descriptors are currently inadequate and structured data availability is limited.

## 113. Digital Twin for Chemical Science: a case study on water interactions on the Ag(111) surface

**Authors:** Jin Qian, Asmita Jana, Siddarth Menon, Andrew E. Bogdan, Rebecca Hamlyn, Johannes Mahl, Ethan J. Crumlin

**Venue:** Nature Computational Science

**Publication Date:** August 27, 2025

**Pages:** 1-8

**DOI:** 10.1038/s43588-025-00857-y

**Abstract:**
Directly visualizing chemical trajectories offers insights into catalysis, gas-phase reactions and photoinduced dynamics. Tracking the transformation of chemical species is best achieved by coupling theory and experiment. Here we developed Digital Twin for Chemical Science (DTCS) v.01, which integrates theory, experiment and their bidirectional feedback loops into a unified platform for chemical characterization. DTCS addresses a core question: given a set of experimental conditions, what is the expected outcome and why? It consists of a forward solver that takes a chemical reaction network and predicts spectra under experimental conditions, and an inverse solver that infers kinetics from measured spectra. We applied DTCS to ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of the Ag–H2O interface as an example. This approach enables real-time knowledge extraction and guides experiments until a stopping condition is met based on accuracy and degeneracy. As a step toward autonomous chemical characterization, DTCS provides mechanistic knowledge in a verified, standardized manner.

## 111. An automated framework for exploring and learning potential-energy surfaces

**Authors:** Yuanbin Liu, Joe D. Morrow, Christina Ertural, Natascia L. Fragapane, John L. A. Gardner, Aakash A. Naik, Yuxing Zhou, Janine George, Volker L. Deringer

**Venue:** Nature Communications

**Publication Date:** August 18, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 16, Issue 1

**Pages:** 7666

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-62510-6

**Abstract:**
Machine learning has become ubiquitous in materials modelling and now routinely enables large-scale atomistic simulations with quantum-mechanical accuracy. However, developing machine-learned interatomic potentials requires high-quality training data, and the manual generation and curation of such data can be a major bottleneck. Here, we introduce an automated framework for the exploration and fitting of potential-energy surfaces, implemented in an openly available software package that we call autoplex (‘automatic potential-landscape explorer’). We discuss design choices, particularly the interoperability with existing software architectures, and the ability for the end user to easily use the computational workflows provided. We show wide-ranging capability demonstrations: for the titanium–oxygen system, SiO2, crystalline and liquid water, as well as phase-change memory materials. More generally, our study illustrates how automation can speed up atomistic machine learning in computational materials science.

## 110. Accelerated design of gold nanoparticles with enhanced plasmonic performance

**Authors:** José Luis Montaño-Priede, Anish Rao, Ana Sánchez-Iglesias, Marek Grzelczak

**DOI:** 10.1126/sciadv.adx2299

**Abstract:**
Finding the optimal dimensions of metal nanoparticles to maximize their plasmonic performance in targeted applications is a complex and time-consuming process that typically requires a trial-and-error approach. Here, we propose a universal pipeline that integrates Bayesian optimization with electrodynamics simulations to find dimensions of gold bipyramids with superior plasmonic performance in photothermal efficiency, enhancement of Raman scattering and photoluminescence, strong coupling between plasmon and exciton, and aggregation-induced color difference. Our workflow is a straightforward tool for plasmonic nanoparticle design, setting their optimal dimensions for targeted applications.

**Venue:** Nature

**Publication Date:** August 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 644, Issue 8075

**Pages:** 89-95

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-025-09269-4

**Abstract:**
Data-driven methodologies have transformed the discovery and prediction of hard materials with well-defined atomic structures by leveraging standardized datasets, enabling accurate property predictions and facilitating efficient exploration of design spaces1–3. However, their application to soft materials remains challenging because of complex, multiscale structure–property relationships4–6. Here we present a data-driven approach that integrates data mining, experimentation and machine learning to design high-performance adhesive hydrogels from scratch, tailored for demanding underwater environments. By leveraging protein databases, we developed a descriptor strategy to statistically replicate protein sequence patterns in polymer strands by ideal random copolymerization, enabling targeted hydrogel design and dataset construction. Using machine learning, we optimized hydrogel formulations from an initial dataset of 180 bioinspired hydrogels, achieving remarkable improvements in adhesive strength, with a maximum value exceeding 1 MPa. These super-adhesive hydrogels hold immense potential across diverse applications, from biomedical engineering to deep-sea exploration, marking a notable advancement in data-driven innovation for soft materials.

## 108. An actor–critic algorithm to maximize the power delivered from direct methanol fuel cells

**Authors:** Hongbin Xu, Yang Jeong Park, Zhichu Ren, Daniel J. Zheng, Davide Menga, Haojun Jia, Chenru Duan, Guanzhou Zhu, Yuriy Román-Leshkov, Yang Shao-Horn, Ju Li

**Venue:** Nature Energy

**Publication Date:** August 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 10, Issue 8

**Pages:** 951-961

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41560-025-01804-x

**Abstract:**
Optimizing nonlinear time-dependent control in complex energy systems such as direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) is a crucial engineering challenge. The long-term power delivery of DMFCs deteriorates as the electrocatalytic surfaces become fouled. Dynamic voltage adjustment can clean the surface and recover the activity of catalysts; however, manually identifying optimal control strategies considering multiple mechanisms is challenging. Here we demonstrated a nonlinear policy model (Alpha-Fuel-Cell) inspired by actor–critic reinforcement learning, which learns directly from real-world current–time trajectories to infer the state of catalysts during operation and generates a suitable action for the next timestep automatically. Moreover, the model can provide protocols to achieve the required power while significantly slowing the degradation of catalysts. Benefiting from this model, the time-averaged power delivered is 153% compared to constant potential operation for DMFCs over 12 hours. Our framework may be generalized to other energy device applications requiring long-time-horizon decision-making in the real world.

## 107. Deep learning for property prediction of natural fiber polymer composites

**Authors:** Ivan P. Malashin, Dmitry Martysyuk, Vladimir Nelyub, Aleksei Borodulin, Andrei Gantimurov, Vadim Tynchenko

**Venue:** Scientific Reports

**Publication Date:** July 30, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 27837

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41598-025-10841-1

**Abstract:**
The increasing availability of diverse experimental and computational data has accelerated the application of deep learning (DL) techniques for predicting polymer properties. A literature review was conducted to show recent advances in DL applied to this field. For example, Li et al. (2023) achieved an $$R^2>0.96$$for predicting stiffness tensors of carbon fiber composites using a hybrid CNN–MLP model trained on microstructure images and two-point statistics. Aligning with this approach, Xue et al. (2023) compared DNN performance with genetic programming and minimax probability machine regression in predicting the lateral confinement coefficient for CFRP-wrapped RC columns, showing competitive predictive capability. These studies demonstrate that specialized architectures, including hybrid CNN–MLP models, feedforward ANNs, graph convolutional networks, and DNNs, provide high accuracy in predicting mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties of polymer composites and biodegradable plastics. Among these, DNNs have consistently shown superior performance in capturing complex nonlinear relationships within heterogeneous datasets, highlighting their suitability for materials characterization and optimization tasks. Building on these insights, this study investigates the effects of four natural fibers (flax, cotton, sisal, hemp) with densities around 1.48–1.54 g/cm$$^3$$, incorporated at 30 wt.% into three polymer matrices (PLA, PP, epoxy resin) with varying surface treatments (untreated, alkaline, silane). Samples were prepared via extrusion and injection molding (or casting for epoxy) under controlled processing conditions. Mechanical properties (tensile strength, modulus, elongation at break, impact toughness) were measured per ASTM standards, and density was determined by Archimedes’ method. Using 180 experimental samples, augmented up to 1500 using bootstrap technique, several regression models–linear, random forest, gradient boosting, DNNs–were developed to predict mechanical behavior. Best DNN model architecture (four hidden layers (128–64–32–16 neurons), ReLU activation, 20% dropout, a batch size of 64, and the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of $$10^{-3}$$) obtained through hyperparameter optimization using Optuna, delivered the best performance (R$$^2$$up to 0.89) and MAE reductions of 9–12% compared to gradient boosting, driven by the DNN’s ability to capture nonlinear synergies between fiber-matrix interactions, surface treatments, and processing parameters while aligning architectural complexity with multiscale material behavior.

**Abstract:**
The pre-trained knowledge compressed in large language models is addressing diverse scientific challenges and catalysing the progression of autonomous laboratory systems, synergized with liquid handling robots. Here we introduce PrimeGen, an orchestrated multi-agent system powered by large language models, designed to streamline labour-intensive primer design tasks for targeted next-generation sequencing. PrimeGen uses GPT-4o as a central controller to engage with experimentalists for task planning and decomposition, coordinating various specialized agents to execute distinct subtasks. These include an interactive search agent for retrieving gene targets from databases, a primer agent for designing primer sequences across multiple scenarios, a protocol agent for generating executable robot scripts through retrieval-augmented generation and prompt engineering, and an experiment agent equipped with a vision language model for detecting and reporting anomalies. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of PrimeGen across a variety of applications. PrimeGen can accommodate up to 955 amplicons, ensuring high amplification uniformity and minimizing dimer formation. Our development underscores the potential of collaborative agents, coordinated by generalist foundation models, as intelligent tools for advancing biomedical research.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 147, Issue 26

**Pages:** 23014-23025

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.5c05916

**Abstract:**
The automation of chemical synthesis presents opportunities to enhance experimental reproducibility and accelerate discovery. Traditional closed-loop approaches, while effective in specific domains, are often constrained by rigid workflows and the requirement for specialized expertise. Here, we introduce a chemical robotic explorer integrated with an artificial intelligence (AI) copilot to enable a more flexible and adaptive synthesis, simplifying the process from inspiration to experimentation. This modular platform uses a large language model (LLM) to map natural language synthetic descriptions to executable unit operations, including temperature control, stirring, liquid and solid handling, filtration, etc. By integrating AI-driven literature searches, real-time experimental design, conversational human–AI interaction, and feedback-based optimization, we demonstrate the capabilities of AI in successfully synthesizing 13 compounds across four distinct classes of inorganic materials: coordination complexes, metal–organic frameworks, nanoparticles, and polyoxometalates. Notably, this approach enabled the discovery of a previously unreported family of Mn–W polyoxometalate clusters, showing the potential of AI-enhanced robotics as a generalizable and adaptable platform for material innovation.

## 102. Self-Evolving Discovery of Carrier Biomaterials with Ultra-Low Nonspecific Protein Adsorption for Single Cell Analysis

**Publication Date:** July 02, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume n/a, Issue n/a

**Pages:** 2506243

**DOI:** 10.1002/adma.202506243

**Abstract:**
Carrier biomaterials used in single-cell analysis face a bottleneck in protein detection sensitivity, primarily attributed to elevated false positives caused by nonspecific protein adsorption. Toward carrier biomaterials with ultra-low nonspecific protein adsorption, a self-evolving discovery is developed to address the challenge of high-dimensional parameter spaces. Automation across nine self-developed or modified workstations is integrated to achieve a “can-do” capability, and develop a synergy-enhanced Bayesian optimization algorithm as the artificial intelligence brain to enable a “can-think” capability for small-data problems inherent to time-consuming biological experiments, thereby establishing a self-evolving discovery for carrier biomaterials. Through this approach, carrier biomaterials with an ultra-low nonspecific protein adsorption index of 0.2537 are successfully discovered, representing an over 80% decrease, while achieving a 10 000-fold reduction in experiment workload. Furthermore, the discovered biomaterials are fabricated into microfluidic-used carriers for protein-analysis applications, showing a 9-fold enhancement in detection sensitivity compared to conventional carriers. This is the very demonstration of a self-evolving discovery for carrier biomaterials, paving the way for advancements in single-cell protein analysis and further its integration with genomics and transcriptomics.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 16, Issue 1

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-61209-y

**Abstract:**
Proteins are the molecular machines of life with numerous applications in energy, health, and sustainability. However, engineering proteins with desired functions for practical applications remains slow, expensive, and specialist-dependent. Here we report a generally applicable platform for autonomous enzyme engineering that integrates machine learning and large language models with biofoundry automation to eliminate the need for human intervention, judgement, and domain expertise. Requiring only an input protein sequence and a quantifiable way to measure fitness, this automated platform can be applied to engineer a wide array of proteins. As a proof of concept, we engineer Arabidopsis thaliana halide methyltransferase (AtHMT) for a 90-fold improvement in substrate preference and 16-fold improvement in ethyltransferase activity, along with developing a Yersinia mollaretii phytase (YmPhytase) variant with 26-fold improvement in activity at neutral pH. This is accomplished in four rounds over 4 weeks, while requiring construction and characterization of fewer than 500 variants for each enzyme. This platform for autonomous experimentation paves the way for rapid advancements across diverse industries, from medicine and biotechnology to renewable energy and sustainable chemistry.

## 99. Machine-learning design of ductile FeNiCoAlTa alloys with high strength

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 643, Issue 8070

**Pages:** 119-124

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-025-09160-2

**Abstract:**
The pursuit of strong yet ductile alloys has been ongoing for centuries. However, for all alloys developed thus far, including recent high-entropy alloys, those possessing good tensile ductility rarely approach 2-GPa yield strength at room temperature. The few that do are mostly ultra-strong steels1–3; however, their stress–strain curves exhibit plateaus and serrations because their tensile flow suffers from plastic instability (such as Lüders strains)1–4, and the elongation is pseudo-uniform at best. Here we report that a group of carefully engineered multi-principal-element alloys, with a composition of Fe35Ni29Co21Al12Ta3 designed by means of domain knowledge-informed machine learning, can be processed to reach an unprecedented range of simultaneously high strength and ductility. An example of this synergy delivers 1.8-GPa yield strength combined with 25% truly uniform elongation. We achieved strengthening by pushing microstructural heterogeneities to the extreme through unusually large volume fractions of not only coherent L12 nanoprecipitates but also incoherent B2 microparticles. The latter, being multicomponent with a reduced chemical ordering energy, is a deformable phase that accumulates dislocations inside to help sustain a high strain hardening rate that prolongs uniform elongation.

**Abstract:**
Self-driving laboratories (SDLs), powered by robotics, automation and artificial intelligence, accelerate scientific discoveries through autonomous experimentation. However, their adoption and transferability are limited by the lack of standardized software across diverse SDLs. In this work, we introduce IvoryOS – an open-source orchestrator that automatically generates web interfaces for Python-based SDLs. It ensures interoperability by dynamically updating the user interfaces with the plugged components and their functionalities. The interfaces enable users to directly control SDLs and design workflows through a drag-and-drop user interface. Additionally, the workflow manager provides no-code configuration for iterative execution, supporting both human-in-the-loop and closed-loop experimentation. We demonstrate the integration of IvoryOS with six SDLs across two institutes, showcasing its adaptability and utility across platforms at various development stages. The plug-and-play and low-code feature of IvoryOS addresses the rapidly evolving demands of SDL development and significantly lowers the barrier to entry for building and managing SDLs.

## 95. A novel training-free approach to efficiently extracting material microstructures via visual large model

**Authors:** Changtai Li, Xu Han, Chao Yao, Yu Guo, Zixin Li, Lei Jiang, Wei Liu, Haiyou Huang, Huadong Fu, Xiaojuan Ban

**Venue:** Acta Materialia

**Publication Date:** May 15, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 290

**Pages:** 120962

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.actamat.2025.120962

**Abstract:**
The precise quantitative description of material microstructures is essential for deeply exploring the relationship between material composition and property. This significant understanding efficiently enables composition design, process optimization, and property enhancement. Traditionally, the analysis of material microstructures has relied heavily on professional expertise. Even with machine /deep learning (ML/DL)-based analysis methods, substantial expert annotation is required for training, and the trained models often suffer from weak generalizability and poor recognition of new images. This study proposed MatSAM (Materials Segment Anything Model), a novel training-free approach for efficient material microstructure extraction based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a type of visual large model (VLM). Integrating region marking and microscopy-adapted points, an automated point-based prompt strategy was developed to achieve accurate and efficient material microstructure recognition. Without any manual annotations, MatSAM precisely identified 11 kinds of metallic material microstructures obtained through various characterization methods. Compared to optimal conventional rule-based methods that do not involve a learning process (non-ML/DL), MatSAM achieved an average relative improvement of 35.4 % in metrics combining the adjusted Rand index (ARI) and Intersection over Union (IoU), outperforming the original SAM by an average of 13.9 %. On four public microstructure segmentation datasets, the IoU of MatSAM showed an average improvement of 7.5 % over corresponding specialist deep models requiring annotations. Meanwhile, MatSAM satisfied the generalization capability of a single model for various microstructures, including grain boundaries, phases, and defects. This approach significantly reduces the labor and computational costs of quantitatively characterizing material microstructures, further accelerating the development of advanced materials.

## 94. Exploration of crystal chemical space using text-guided generative artificial intelligence

**Authors:** Hyunsoo Park, Anthony Onwuli, Aron Walsh

**Venue:** Nature Communications

**Publication Date:** May 12, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 16, Issue 1

**Pages:** 4379

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-59636-y

**Abstract:**
The vastness of chemical space presents a long-standing challenge for the exploration of new compounds with pre-determined properties. In materials science, crystal structure prediction has become a mature tool for mapping from composition to structure based on global optimisation techniques. Generative artificial intelligence now offers the means to efficiently navigate larger regions of crystal chemical space informed by structure-property datasets of materials. Here, we introduce a model, named Chemeleon, designed to generate chemical compositions and crystal structures by learning from both textual descriptions and three-dimensional structural data. The model employs denoising diffusion techniques for compound generation using textual inputs aligned with structural data via cross-modal contrastive learning. The potential of this approach is demonstrated for multi-component compound generation, including the Zn-Ti-O ternary space, and the prediction of stable phases in the Li-P-S-Cl quaternary space of relevance to solid-state batteries.

## 93. Using GNN property predictors as molecule generators

**Authors:** Félix Therrien, Edward H. Sargent, Oleksandr Voznyy

**Venue:** Nature Communications

**Publication Date:** May 08, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 16, Issue 1

**Pages:** 4301

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-59439-1

**Abstract:**
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools to accurately predict materials and molecular properties in computational and automated discovery pipelines. In this article, we exploit the invertible nature of these neural networks to directly generate molecular structures with desired electronic properties. Starting from a random graph or an existing molecule, we perform a gradient ascent while holding the GNN weights fixed in order to optimize its input, the molecular graph, towards the target property. Valence rules are enforced strictly through a judicious graph construction. The method relies entirely on the property predictor; no additional training is required on molecular structures. We demonstrate the application of this method by generating molecules with specific energy gaps verified with density functional theory (DFT) and with specific octanol-water partition coefficients (logP). Our approach hits target properties with rates comparable to or better than state-of-the-art generative models while consistently generating more diverse molecules. Moreover, while validating our framework we created a dataset of 1617 new molecules and their corresponding DFT-calculated properties that could serve as an out-of-distribution test set for QM9-trained models.

**Venue:** Nature

**Publication Date:** May 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 641, Issue 8065

**Pages:** 1172-1179

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-025-08897-0

**Abstract:**
Weather prediction is critical for a range of human activities, including transportation, agriculture and industry, as well as for the safety of the general public. Machine learning transforms numerical weather prediction (NWP) by replacing the numerical solver with neural networks, improving the speed and accuracy of the forecasting component of the prediction pipeline1–6. However, current models rely on numerical systems at initialization and to produce local forecasts, thereby limiting their achievable gains. Here we show that a single machine learning model can replace the entire NWP pipeline. Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end data-driven weather prediction system, ingests observations and produces global gridded forecasts and local station forecasts. The global forecasts outperform an operational NWP baseline for several variables and lead times. The local station forecasts are skilful for up to ten days of lead time, competing with a post-processed global NWP baseline and a state-of-the-art end-to-end forecasting system with input from human forecasters. End-to-end tuning further improves the accuracy of local forecasts. Our results show that skilful forecasting is possible without relying on NWP at deployment time, which will enable the realization of the full speed and accuracy benefits of data-driven models. We believe that Aardvark Weather will be the starting point for a new generation of end-to-end models that will reduce computational costs by orders of magnitude and enable the rapid, affordable creation of customized models for a range of end users.

**Pages:** 296-308

**DOI:** 10.1038/s44286-025-00227-5

**Abstract:**
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has enabled two-dimensional (2D) materials and their heterostructures to become promising material platforms for next-generation electronics and photonic devices. However, the robust processing of 2D materials produced by CVD is currently hindered by the lack of a scalable and reliable technique to transfer materials from their growth substrates to target substrates for end applications. Here we introduced an automated system to enable the transfer of CVD-grown 2D materials with robotics by engineering the interfacial adhesion and strain. The developed automated transfer system shows industrial compatibility, as demonstrated by the high production capability (up to 180 wafers per day), reliable transfer quality (with transferred graphene carrier mobilities over 14,000 cm2 V−1 s−1), and high uniformity and repeatability of the transferred materials. The developed system also outperforms conventional manual transfer methods in terms of minimizing cost and environmental impact. This automated system could accelerate the research and commercialization of 2D materials in the future.

**Abstract:**
Developing advanced catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for sustainable hydrogen production. This study presents a multistage machine learning (ML) approach to streamline the discovery and optimization of complex multimetallic catalysts. Our method integrates data mining, active learning, and domain adaptation throughout the materials discovery process.

Then, the active learning module efficiently refines element composition and synthesis conditions through iterative experimental feedback. The process culminated in the discovery of a promising Ru-Mn-Ca-Pr oxide catalyst. Our workflow also enhances theoretical simulations with domain adaptation strategy, providing deeper mechanistic insights aligned with experimental findings.

Key molecular features governing additive performance were elucidated using Shapley Additive exPlanations and Spearman’s correlation, pinpointing high-performance candidates like cis-4-hydroxy-d-proline, which achieved an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.52% over 200 cycles. The workflow established herein is highly adaptable, offering a powerful framework for accelerating the exploration and optimization of extensive chemical spaces across diverse energy storage and conversion fields.

**Pages:** 624-632

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-025-08628-5

**Abstract:**
The design of functional materials with desired properties is essential in driving technological advances in areas such as energy storage, catalysis and carbon capture1–3. Generative models accelerate materials design by directly generating new materials given desired property constraints, but current methods have a low success rate in proposing stable crystals or can satisfy only a limited set of property constraints4–11. Here we present MatterGen, a model that generates stable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further be fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property constraints. Compared with previous generative models4,12, structures produced by MatterGen are more than twice as likely to be new and stable, and more than ten times closer to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully generates stable, new materials with desired chemistry, symmetry and mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. As a proof of concept, we synthesize one of the generated structures and measure its property value to be within 20% of our target. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of abilities of MatterGen represent an important advancement towards creating a foundational generative model for materials design.

## 81. Developing novel low-density high-entropy superalloys with high strength and superior creep resistance guided by automated machine learning

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 285

**Pages:** 120656

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.actamat.2024.120656

**Abstract:**
Design of novel superalloys with low density, high strength, and great microstructural stability is a big challenge. This work used an automated machine learning (ML) model to explore high-entropy superalloys (HESAs) with coherent γ' nanoprecipitates in the FCC-γ matrix. The database samples were firstly preprocessed via the domain-knowledge before ML. Both autogluon and genetic algorithm methods were applied to establish the relationship between the alloy composition and yield strength and to deal with the optimization problem in ML. Thus, the ML model cannot only predict the strength with a high accuracy (R2 > 95 %), but also design compositions efficiently with desired property in multi-component systems. Novel HESAs with targeted strengths and densities were predicted by ML and then validated by a series of experiments. It is found that the experimental results are well consistent with the predicted properties, as evidenced by the fact that the designed Ni-5.82Fe-15.34Co-2.53Al-2.99Ti-2.90Nb-15.97Cr-2.50Mo (wt.%) HESA has a yield strength of 1346 MPa at room temperature and 1061 MPa at 1023 K and a density of 7.98 g/cm3. Moreover, it exhibits superior creep resistance with a rupture lifetime of 149 h under 480 MPa at 1023 K, outperforming most conventional wrought superalloys. Additionally, the coarsening rate of γ' nanoprecipitates in these alloys is extremely slow at 1023 K, showing a prominent microstructural stability. The strengthening and deformation mechanisms were further discussed. This framework provides a new pathway to realize the property-oriented composition design for high-performance complex alloys via ML.

**Abstract:**
Chemistry experiments can be resource- and labor-intensive, often requiring manual tasks like polishing electrodes in electrochemistry. Traditional lab automation infrastructure faces challenges adapting to new experiments. To address this, we introduce ORGANA, an assistive robotic system that automates diverse chemistry experiments using decision-making and perception tools. It makes decisions with chemists in the loop to control robots and lab devices. ORGANA interacts with chemists using large language models (LLMs) to derive experiment goals, handle disambiguation, and provide experiment logs. ORGANA plans and executes complex tasks with visual feedback while supporting scheduling and parallel task execution. We demonstrate ORGANA’s capabilities in solubility, pH measurement, recrystallization, and electrochemistry experiments. In electrochemistry, it executes a 19-step plan in parallel to characterize quinone derivatives for flow batteries. Our user study shows ORGANA reduces frustration and physical demand by over 50%, with users saving an average of 80.3% of their time when using it.

**DOI:** 10.1002/ange.202417657

**Abstract:**
The vast size of composition space poses a significant challenge for materials chemistry: exhaustive enumeration of potentially interesting compositions is typically infeasible, hindering assessment of important criteria ranging from novelty and stability to cost and performance. We report a tool, Comgen, for the efficient exploration of composition space, which makes use of logical methods from computer science used for proving theorems. We demonstrate how these techniques, which have not previously been applied to materials discovery, can enable reasoning about scientific domain knowledge provided by human experts. Comgen accepts a variety of user-specified criteria, converts these into an abstract form, and utilises a powerful automated reasoning algorithm to identify compositions that satisfy these user requirements, or prove that the requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied. In contrast to machine learning techniques, explicitly reasoning about domain knowledge, rather than making inferences from data, ensures that Comgen's outputs are fully interpretable and provably correct. Users interact with Comgen through a high-level Python interface. We illustrate use of the tool with several case studies focused on the search for new ionic conductors. Further, we demonstrate the integration of Comgen into an end-to-end automated workflow to propose and evaluate candidate compositions quantitatively, prior to experimental investigation. This highlights the potential of automated formal reasoning in materials chemistry.

Using ensemble learning, predictive models are integrated to capture the relationships between composition, crystal structure, mechanical, and magnetic properties. This framework offers a robust pathway for accelerating the discovery of next-generation alloys with high hardness and magnetic softness, highlighting the transformative impact of data-driven strategies in material design.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 282

**Pages:** 120467

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.actamat.2024.120467

**Abstract:**
Ferroelectric topological phases and phase transitions have been extensively investigated recently due to the rich physical insights and potential applications in next-generation electronic devices. However, precisely predicting the topological phase transitions under different internal and external conditions in polar oxide superlattice systems is challenging due to the complex energy competitions and highly nonlinear kinetics involved. Herein, we adopted a state-of-the-art mathematical concept called “persistent homology” from topological data analysis to extract the essential topological features for the polarization data in various topological structures. By implementing the persistent image as the descriptor, support vector regression (SVR) based convolutional neural network (CNN) models are developed for the automated and high precision classification and regression of topological states based on high-dimensional phase-field simulation data of the PTO/STO superlattice. Using this method, we can automatically construct the strain and electric field phase diagrams in seconds with high throughput phase-field data. We hope to spur further interest in the integration of state-of-the-art mathematical tools, machine learning algorithms, and condensed matter physics for predictions of topological phase transitions.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 37, Issue 22

**Pages:** 2413523

**DOI:** 10.1002/adma.202413523

**Abstract:**
A key challenge in artificial intelligence (AI) is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts is presented: (1) large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi-agent systems with in-situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses human research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the system yields material discoveries, critiques and improves existing hypotheses, retrieves up-to-date data about existing research, and highlights strengths and limitations. This is achieved by harnessing a “swarm of intelligence” similar to biological systems, providing new avenues for discovery. How this model accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles, resulting in a new biocomposite with enhanced mechanical properties and improved sustainability through energy-efficient production is shown.

**Authors:** Ilan Price, Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez, Ferran Alet, Tom R. Andersson, Andrew El-Kadi, Dominic Masters, Timo Ewalds, Jacklynn Stott, Shakir Mohamed, Peter Battaglia, Remi Lam, Matthew Willson

**Venue:** Nature

**Publication Date:** January 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 637, Issue 8044

**Pages:** 84-90

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-024-08252-9

**Abstract:**
Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather to planning renewable energy use. Traditionally, weather forecasts have been based on numerical weather prediction (NWP)1, which relies on physics-based simulations of the atmosphere. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with less forecast error than single NWP simulations2,3. However, these advances have focused primarily on single, deterministic forecasts that fail to represent uncertainty and estimate risk. Overall, MLWP has remained less accurate and reliable than state-of-the-art NWP ensemble forecasts. Here we introduce GenCast, a probabilistic weather model with greater skill and speed than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world, ENS, the ensemble forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts4. GenCast is an ML weather prediction method, trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-h steps and 0.25° latitude–longitude resolution, for more than 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8 min. It has greater skill than ENS on 97.2% of 1,320 targets we evaluated and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclone tracks and wind power production. This work helps open the next chapter in operational weather forecasting, in which crucial weather-dependent decisions are made more accurately and efficiently.

**Publication Date:** 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 37, Issue 1

**Pages:** 2412337

**DOI:** 10.1002/adma.202412337

**Abstract:**
Nanoparticles (NPs) of high entropy materials (HEMs) have attracted significant attention due to their versatility and wide range of applications. HEM NPs can be synthesized by fragmenting bulk HEMs or disintegrating and recrystallizing them. Alternatively, directly producing HEMs in NP form from atomic/ionic/molecular precursors presents a significant challenge. A widely adopted strategy involves thermodynamically driving HEM NP formation by leveraging the entropic contribution but incorporating strategies to limit NP growth at the elevated temperatures used for maximizing entropy. A second approach is to kinetically drive HEM NP formation by promoting rapid reactions of homogeneous reactant mixtures or using highly diluted precursor dissolutions. Additionally, experimental evidence suggests that enthalpy plays a significant role in driving HEM NP formation processes at moderate temperatures, with the high energy cost of generating additional surfaces and interfaces at the nanoscale stabilizing the HEM phase. This review critically assesses the various synthesis strategies developed for HEM NP preparation, highlighting key illustrative examples and offering insights into the underlying formation mechanisms. Such insights are critical for fine-tuning experimental conditions to achieve specific outcomes, ultimately enabling the effective synthesis of optimized generations of these advanced materials for both current and emerging applications across various scientific and technological fields.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 37, Issue 32

**Pages:** 2502771

**DOI:** 10.1002/adma.202502771

**Abstract:**
Large language models (LLMs) are steering the development of generalist materials intelligence (GMI), a unified framework integrating conceptual reasoning, computational modeling, and experimental validation. Central to this framework is the agent-in-the-loop paradigm, where LLM-based agents function as dynamic orchestrators, synthesizing multimodal knowledge, specialized models, and experimental robotics to enable fully autonomous discovery. Drawing from a comprehensive review of LLMs’ transformative impact across representative applications in materials science, including data extraction, property prediction, structure generation, synthesis planning, and self-driven labs, this study underscores how LLMs are revolutionizing traditional tasks, catalyzing the agent-in-the-loop paradigm, and bridging the ontology-concept-computation-experiment continuum. Then the unique challenges of scaling up LLM adoption are discussed, particularly those arising from the misalignment of foundation LLMs with materials-specific knowledge, emphasizing the need to enhance adaptability, efficiency, sustainability, interpretability, and trustworthiness in the pursuit of GMI. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that LLMs are not universally efficient. Their substantial resource demands and inconsistent performance call for careful deployment based on demonstrated task suitability. To address these realities, actionable strategies and a progressive roadmap for equitably and democratically implementing materials-aware LLMs in real-world practices are proposed.

**Abstract:**
Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a pioneering tool in advancing the research application of high-performance solid-state hydrogen storage materials (HSMs). This review summarizes the state-of-the-art research of ML in resolving crucial issues such as low hydrogen storage capacity and unfavorable de-/hydrogenation cycling conditions.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 5, Issue 1

**Pages:** 269

**DOI:** 10.1038/s43246-024-00708-9

**Abstract:**
Automated data extraction from materials science literature at scale using artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques is critical to advance materials discovery. However, this process for large spans of text continues to be a challenge due to the specific nature and styles of scientific manuscripts. In this study, we present a framework to automatically extract polymer-property data from full-text journal articles using commercially available (GPT-3.5) and open-source (LlaMa 2) large language models (LLM), in tandem with the named entity recognition (NER)-based MaterialsBERT model. Leveraging a corpus of ~ 2.4 million full text articles, our method successfully identified and processed around 681,000 polymer-related articles, resulting in the extraction of over one million records corresponding to 24 properties of over 106,000 unique polymers. We additionally conducted an extensive evaluation of the performance and associated costs of the LLMs used for data extraction, compared to the NER model. We suggest methodologies to optimize costs, provide insights on effective inference via in-context few-shots learning, and illuminate gaps and opportunities for future studies utilizing LLMs for natural language processing in polymer science. The extracted polymer-property data has been made publicly available for the wider scientific community via the Polymer Scholar website.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 10160

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-54457-x

**Abstract:**
The rapid emergence of large language model (LLM) technology presents promising opportunities to facilitate the development of synthetic reactions. In this work, we leveraged the power of GPT-4 to build an LLM-based reaction development framework (LLM-RDF) to handle fundamental tasks involved throughout the chemical synthesis development. LLM-RDF comprises six specialized LLM-based agents, including Literature Scouter, Experiment Designer, Hardware Executor, Spectrum Analyzer, Separation Instructor, and Result Interpreter, which are pre-prompted to accomplish the designated tasks. A web application with LLM-RDF as the backend was built to allow chemist users to interact with automated experimental platforms and analyze results via natural language, thus, eliminating the need for coding skills and ensuring accessibility for all chemists. We demonstrated the capabilities of LLM-RDF in guiding the end-to-end synthesis development process for the copper/TEMPO catalyzed aerobic alcohol oxidation to aldehyde reaction, including literature search and information extraction, substrate scope and condition screening, reaction kinetics study, reaction condition optimization, reaction scale-up and product purification. Furthermore, LLM-RDF’s broader applicability and versability was validated on various synthesis tasks of three distinct reactions (SNAr reaction, photoredox C-C cross-coupling reaction, and heterogeneous photoelectrochemical reaction).

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 146, Issue 44

**Pages:** 30340-30348

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.4c10244

**Abstract:**
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is a cornerstone technique in materials characterization. However, complete structure determination from PXRD patterns alone remains time-consuming and is often intractable, especially for novel materials. Current machine learning (ML) approaches to PXRD analysis predict only a subset of the total information that comprises a crystal structure. We developed a pioneering generative ML model designed to solve crystal structures from real-world experimental PXRD data. In addition to strong performance on simulated diffraction patterns, we demonstrate full structure solutions over a large set of experimental diffraction patterns. Benchmarking our model, we predicted the structure for 134 experimental patterns from the RRUFF database and thousands of simulated patterns from the Materials Project on which our model achieves state-of-the-art 42 and 67% match rate, respectively. Further, we applied our model to determine the unreported structures of materials such as NaCu2P2, Ca2MnTeO6, ZrGe6Ni6, LuOF, and HoNdV2O8 from the Powder Diffraction File database. We extended this methodology to new materials created in our lab at high pressure with previously unsolved structures and found the new binary compounds Rh3Bi, RuBi2, and KBi3. We expect that our model will open avenues toward materials discovery under conditions which preclude single crystal growth and toward automated materials discovery pipelines, opening the door to new domains of chemistry.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 635, Issue 8040

**Pages:** 890-897

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-024-08173-7

**Abstract:**
Autonomous laboratories can accelerate discoveries in chemical synthesis, but this requires automated measurements coupled with reliable decision-making1,2. Most autonomous laboratories involve bespoke automated equipment3–6, and reaction outcomes are often assessed using a single, hard-wired characterization technique7. Any decision-making algorithms8 must then operate using this narrow range of characterization data9,10. By contrast, manual experiments tend to draw on a wider range of instruments to characterize reaction products, and decisions are rarely taken based on one measurement alone. Here we show that a synthesis laboratory can be integrated into an autonomous laboratory by using mobile robots11–13 that operate equipment and make decisions in a human-like way. Our modular workflow combines mobile robots, an automated synthesis platform, a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometer and a benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. This allows robots to share existing laboratory equipment with human researchers without monopolizing it or requiring extensive redesign. A heuristic decision-maker processes the orthogonal measurement data, selecting successful reactions to take forward and automatically checking the reproducibility of any screening hits. We exemplify this approach in the three areas of structural diversification chemistry, supramolecular host–guest chemistry and photochemical synthesis. This strategy is particularly suited to exploratory chemistry that can yield multiple potential products, as for supramolecular assemblies, where we also extend the method to an autonomous function assay by evaluating host–guest binding properties.

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.4c10294

**Abstract:**
Exploratory synthesis of solids is essential for the advancement of materials science but is also highly time- and resource-intensive. Here, we demonstrate an efficient strategy to explore solid-state synthesis of quaternary cesium chlorides in the search space of CsnAIBCl6 (n = 2 or 3, A = Li, Na or K, and B = d or p-block metal), where the target compositions are selected from a pool of candidates based on computationally predicted stabilities and availability of viable precursor powders. Synthesizability of the targets is assessed by observing the evolution of starting phases upon heating under in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Laboratory synthesis is attempted for promising targets, and resulting materials are characterized by powder X-ray and neutron diffraction and subsequent Rietveld refinement. We focus on how computational predictions can be bridged to experimental characterizations in exploratory synthesis and report on successful and failed synthesis attempts for compounds of type Cs2AIBIIICl6, revealing underexplored variants including new polymorphs of Cs2LiCrCl6 and Cs2LiRuCl6, and a new compound Cs2LiIrCl6.

**Abstract:**
Laboratories in chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science are at the leading edge of technology, discovering molecules and materials to unlock capabilities in energy, catalysis, biotechnology, sustainability, electronics, and more. Yet, most modern laboratories resemble factories from generations past, with a large reliance on humans manually performing synthesis and characterization tasks. Robotics and automation can enable scientific experiments to be conducted faster, more safely, more accurately, and with greater reproducibility, allowing scientists to tackle large societal problems in domains such as health and energy on a shorter timescale. We define five levels of laboratory automation, from laboratory assistance to full automation. We also introduce robotics research challenges that arise when increasing levels of automation and when increasing the generality of tasks within the laboratory. Robots are poised to transform science labs into automated factories of discovery that accelerate scientific progress.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 8148

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-52378-3

**Abstract:**
In computational molecular and materials science, determining equilibrium structures is the crucial first step for accurate subsequent property calculations. However, the recent discovery of millions of new crystals and super large twisted structures has challenged traditional computational methods, both ab initio and machine-learning-based, due to their computationally intensive iterative processes. To address these scalability issues, here we introduce DeepRelax, a deep generative model capable of performing geometric crystal structure relaxation rapidly and without iterations. DeepRelax learns the equilibrium structural distribution, enabling it to predict relaxed structures directly from their unrelaxed ones. The ability to perform structural relaxation at the millisecond level per structure, combined with the scalability of parallel processing, makes DeepRelax particularly useful for large-scale virtual screening. We demonstrate DeepRelax’s reliability and robustness by applying it to five diverse databases, including oxides, Materials Project, two-dimensional materials, van der Waals crystals, and crystals with point defects. DeepRelax consistently shows high accuracy and efficiency, validated by density functional theory calculations. Finally, we enhance its trustworthiness by integrating uncertainty quantification. This work significantly accelerates computational workflows, offering a robust and trustworthy machine-learning method for material discovery and advancing the application of AI for science.

## 51. Fine-tuning protein language models boosts predictions across diverse tasks

**Authors:** Robert Schmirler, Michael Heinzinger, Burkhard Rost

**Venue:** Nature Communications

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 7407

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-51844-2

**Abstract:**
Prediction methods inputting embeddings from protein language models have reached or even surpassed state-of-the-art performance on many protein prediction tasks. In natural language processing fine-tuning large language models has become the de facto standard. In contrast, most protein language model-based protein predictions do not back-propagate to the language model. Here, we compare the fine-tuning of three state-of-the-art models (ESM2, ProtT5, Ankh) on eight different tasks. Two results stand out. Firstly, task-specific supervised fine-tuning almost always improves downstream predictions. Secondly, parameter-efficient fine-tuning can reach similar improvements consuming substantially fewer resources at up to 4.5-fold acceleration of training over fine-tuning full models. Our results suggest to always try fine-tuning, in particular for problems with small datasets, such as for fitness landscape predictions of a single protein. For ease of adaptability, we provide easy-to-use notebooks to fine-tune all models used during this work for per-protein (pooling) and per-residue prediction tasks.

## 50. Machine learning enables the discovery of 2D Invar and anti-Invar monolayers

**Authors:** Shun Tian, Ke Zhou, Wanjian Yin, Yilun Liu

**Venue:** Nature Communications

**Publication Date:** August 14, 2024

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 6977

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-51379-6

**Abstract:**
Materials demonstrating positive thermal expansion (PTE) or negative thermal expansion (NTE) are quite common, whereas those exhibiting zero thermal expansion (ZTE) are notably scarce. In this work, we identify the mechanical descriptors, namely in-plane tensile stiffness and out-of-plane bending stiffness, that can effectively classify PTE and NTE 2D crystals. By utilizing high throughput calculations and the state-of-the-art symbolic regression method, these descriptors aid in the discovery of ZTE or 2D Invar monolayers with the linear thermal expansion coefficient (LTEC) within ±2 × 10−6 K−1 in the middle range of temperatures. Additionally, the descriptors assist the discovery of large PTE and NTE 2D monolayers with the LTEC larger than ±15 × 10−6 K−1, which are so-called 2D anti-Invar monolayers. Advancing our understanding of materials with exceptionally low or high thermal expansion is of substantial scientific and technological interest, particularly in the development of next-generation electronics at the nanometer or even Ångstrom scale.

**Pages:** 6554

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-50884-y

**Abstract:**
Accelerating perovskite solid solution discovery and sustainable synthesis is crucial for addressing challenges in wireless communication and biosensors. However, the vast array of chemical compositions and their dependence on factors such as crystal structure, and sintering temperature require time-consuming manual processes. To overcome these constraints, we introduce an automated materials discovery approach encompassing machine learning (ML) assisted material screening, robotic synthesis, and high-throughput characterization. Our proposed platform for rapid sintering and dielectric analysis streamlines the characterization of perovskites and the discovery of disordered materials. The setup has been successfully validated, demonstrating processing materials within minutes, in stark contrast to conventional procedures that can take hours or days. Following setup validation with established samples, we showcase synthesizing single-phase solid solutions within the barium family, such as (BaxSr1-x)CeO3, identified through ML-guided chemistry.

## 48. Compositional design of multicomponent alloys using reinforcement learning

**Authors:** Yuehui Xian, Pengfei Dang, Yuan Tian, Xue Jiang, Yumei Zhou, Xiangdong Ding, Jun Sun, Turab Lookman, Dezhen Xue

**Venue:** Acta Materialia

**Publication Date:** August 01, 2024

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 274

**Pages:** 120017

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.actamat.2024.120017

**Abstract:**
The design of alloys has typically involved adaptive experimental synthesis and characterization guided by machine learning models fitted to available data. A bottleneck for sequential design, be it for self-driven or manual synthesis, by Bayesian Global Optimization (BGO) for example, is that the search space becomes intractable as the number of alloy elements and its compositions exceed a threshold. Here we investigate how reinforcement learning (RL) performs in the compositional design of alloys within a closed loop with manual synthesis and characterization. We demonstrate this strategy by designing a phase change multicomponent alloy (Ti27.2Ni47Hf13.8Zr12) with the highest transformation enthalpy (ΔH) -37.1 J/g (-39.0 J/g with further calibration) within the TiNi-based family of alloys from a space of over 2 × 108 candidates, although the initial training is only on a compact dataset of 112 alloys. We show how the training efficiency is increased by employing acquisition functions containing uncertainties, such as expected improvement (EI), as the reward itself. Existing alloy data is often limited, however, if the agent is pretrained on experimental results prior to the training process, it can access regions of higher reward values more frequently. In addition, the experimental feedback enables the agent to gradually explore new regions with higher rewards, compositionally different from the initial dataset. Our approach directly applies to processing conditions where the actions would be performed in a given order. We also compare RL performance to BGO and the genetic algorithm on several test functions to gain insight on their relative strengths in materials design.

**Authors:** Chi Chen, Dan Thien Nguyen, Shannon J. Lee, Nathan A. Baker, Ajay S. Karakoti, Linda Lauw, Craig Owen, Karl T. Mueller, Brian A. Bilodeau, Vijayakumar Murugesan, Matthias Troyer

**Venue:** Journal of the American Chemical Society

**Publication Date:** July 24, 2024

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 146, Issue 29

**Pages:** 20009-20018

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.4c03849

**Abstract:**
High-throughput computational materials discovery has promised significant acceleration of the design and discovery of new materials for many years. Despite a surge in interest and activity, the constraints imposed by large-scale computational resources present a significant bottleneck. Furthermore, examples of large-scale computational discovery carried through experimental validation remain scarce, especially for materials with product applicability. Here we demonstrate how this vision became reality by first combining state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) models and traditional physics-based models on cloud high-performance computing (HPC) resources to quickly navigate through more than 32 million candidates and predict around half a million potentially stable materials. By focusing on solid-state electrolytes for battery applications, our discovery pipeline further identified 18 promising candidates with new compositions and rediscovered a decade's worth of collective knowledge in the field as a byproduct. By employing around one thousand virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud, this process took less than 80 hours. We then synthesized and experimentally characterized the structures and conductivities of our top candidates, the Na$_x$Li$_{3-x}$YCl$_6$ ($0 < x < 3$) series, demonstrating the potential of these compounds to serve as solid electrolytes. Additional candidate materials that are currently under experimental investigation could offer more examples of the computational discovery of new phases of Li- and Na-conducting solid electrolytes. We believe that this unprecedented approach of synergistically integrating AI models and cloud HPC not only accelerates materials discovery but also showcases the potency of AI-guided experimentation in unlocking transformative scientific breakthroughs with real-world applications.

## 45. From bulk effective mass to 2D carrier mobility accurate prediction via adversarial transfer learning

**Authors:** Xinyu Chen, Shuaihua Lu, Qian Chen, Qionghua Zhou, Jinlan Wang

**Venue:** Nature Communications

**Publication Date:** June 25, 2024

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 5391

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-49686-z

**Abstract:**
Data scarcity is one of the critical bottlenecks to utilizing machine learning in material discovery. Transfer learning can use existing big data to assist property prediction on small data sets, but the premise is that there must be a strong correlation between large and small data sets. To extend its applicability in scenarios with different properties and materials, here we develop a hybrid framework combining adversarial transfer learning and expert knowledge, which enables the direct prediction of carrier mobility of two-dimensional (2D) materials using the knowledge learned from bulk effective mass. Specifically, adversarial training ensures that only common knowledge between bulk and 2D materials is extracted while expert knowledge is incorporated to further improve the prediction accuracy and generalizability. Successfully, 2D carrier mobilities are predicted with the accuracy over 90% from only crystal structure, and 21 2D semiconductors with carrier mobilities far exceeding silicon and suitable bandgap are successfully screened out. This work enables transfer learning in simultaneous cross-property and cross-material scenarios, providing an effective tool to predict intricate material properties with limited data.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 4940

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-49170-8

**Abstract:**
Dielectric capacitors offer great potential for advanced electronics due to their high power densities, but their energy density still needs to be further improved. High-entropy strategy has emerged as an effective method for improving energy storage performance, however, discovering new high-entropy systems within a high-dimensional composition space is a daunting challenge for traditional trial-and-error experiments. Here, based on phase-field simulations and limited experimental data, we propose a generative learning approach to accelerate the discovery of high-entropy dielectrics in a practically infinite exploration space of over 1011 combinations. By encoding-decoding latent space regularities to facilitate data sampling and forward inference, we employ inverse design to screen out the most promising combinations via a ranking strategy. Through only 5 sets of targeted experiments, we successfully obtain a Bi(Mg0.5Ti0.5)O3-based high-entropy dielectric film with a significantly improved energy density of 156 J cm−3 at an electric field of 5104 kV cm−1, surpassing the pristine film by more than eight-fold. This work introduces an effective and innovative avenue for designing high-entropy dielectrics with drastically reduced experimental cycles, which could be also extended to expedite the design of other multicomponent material systems with desired properties.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-49172-6

**Abstract:**
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have versatile applications in luminescence, whereas identifying optimal synthesis conditions has been challenging due to numerous synthesis parameters and multiple desired outcomes, creating an enormous search space. In this study, we present a novel multi-objective optimization strategy utilizing a machine learning (ML) algorithm to intelligently guide the hydrothermal synthesis of CQDs. Our closed-loop approach learns from limited and sparse data, greatly reducing the research cycle and surpassing traditional trial-and-error methods. Moreover, it also reveals the intricate links between synthesis parameters and target properties and unifies the objective function to optimize multiple desired properties like full-color photoluminescence (PL) wavelength and high PL quantum yields (PLQY). With only 63 experiments, we achieve the synthesis of full-color fluorescent CQDs with high PLQY exceeding 60% across all colors. Our study represents a significant advancement in ML-guided CQDs synthesis, setting the stage for developing new materials with multiple desired properties.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-024-07487-w

**Abstract:**
The introduction of AlphaFold 21 has spurred a revolution in modelling the structure of proteins and their interactions, enabling a huge range of applications in protein modelling and design2–6. Here we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein–ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein–nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody–antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37,8. Together, these results show that high-accuracy modelling across biomolecular space is possible within a single unified deep-learning framework.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 4677

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-49125-z

**Abstract:**
Electron microscopy (EM) revolutionized the way to visualize cellular ultrastructure. Volume EM (vEM) has further broadened its three-dimensional nanoscale imaging capacity. However, intrinsic trade-offs between imaging speed and quality of EM restrict the attainable imaging area and volume. Isotropic imaging with vEM for large biological volumes remains unachievable. Here, we developed EMDiffuse, a suite of algorithms designed to enhance EM and vEM capabilities, leveraging the cutting-edge image generation diffusion model. EMDiffuse generates realistic predictions with high resolution ultrastructural details and exhibits robust transferability by taking only one pair of images of 3 megapixels to fine-tune in denoising and super-resolution tasks. EMDiffuse also demonstrated proficiency in the isotropic vEM reconstruction task, generating isotropic volume even in the absence of isotropic training data. We demonstrated the robustness of EMDiffuse by generating isotropic volumes from seven public datasets obtained from different vEM techniques and instruments. The generated isotropic volume enables accurate three-dimensional nanoscale ultrastructure analysis. EMDiffuse also features self-assessment functionalities on predictions’ reliability. We envision EMDiffuse to pave the way for investigations of the intricate subcellular nanoscale ultrastructure within large volumes of biological systems.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s44160-024-00502-y

**Abstract:**
Efficient synthesis recipes are needed to streamline the manufacturing of complex materials and to accelerate the realization of theoretically predicted materials. Often, the solid-state synthesis of multicomponent oxides is impeded by undesired by-product phases, which can kinetically trap reactions in an incomplete non-equilibrium state. Here we report a thermodynamic strategy to navigate high-dimensional phase diagrams in search of precursors that circumvent low-energy, competing by-products, while maximizing the reaction energy to drive fast phase transformation kinetics. Using a robotic inorganic materials synthesis laboratory, we perform a large-scale experimental validation of our precursor selection principles. For a set of 35 target quaternary oxides, with chemistries representative of intercalation battery cathodes and solid-state electrolytes, our robot performs 224 reactions spanning 27 elements with 28 unique precursors, operated by 1 human experimentalist. Our predicted precursors frequently yield target materials with higher phase purity than traditional precursors. Robotic laboratories offer an exciting platform for data-driven experimental synthesis science, from which we can develop fundamental insights to guide both human and robotic chemists.

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.3c11852

**Abstract:**
Determining the structures of previously unseen compounds from experimental characterizations is a crucial part of materials science. It requires a step of searching for the structure type that conforms to the lattice of the unknown compound, which enables the pattern matching process for characterization data, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. However, this procedure typically places a high demand on domain expertise, thus creating an obstacle for computer-driven automation. Here, we address this challenge by leveraging a deep-learning model composed of a union of convolutional residual neural networks. The accuracy of the model is demonstrated on a dataset of over 60,000 different compounds for 100 structure types, and additional categories can be integrated without the need to retrain the existing networks. We also unravel the operation of the deep-learning black box and highlight the way in which the resemblance between the unknown compound and a structure type is quantified based on both local and global characteristics in XRD patterns. This computational tool opens new avenues for automating structure analysis on materials unearthed in high-throughput experimentation.

## 35. Extracting accurate materials data from research papers with conversational language models and prompt engineering

**Authors:** Maciej P. Polak, Dane Morgan

**Venue:** Nature Communications

**Publication Date:** February 21, 2024

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 1569

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-45914-8

**Abstract:**
There has been a growing effort to replace manual extraction of data from research papers with automated data extraction based on natural language processing, language models, and recently, large language models (LLMs). Although these methods enable efficient extraction of data from large sets of research papers, they require a significant amount of up-front effort, expertise, and coding. In this work, we propose the ChatExtract method that can fully automate very accurate data extraction with minimal initial effort and background, using an advanced conversational LLM. ChatExtract consists of a set of engineered prompts applied to a conversational LLM that both identify sentences with data, extract that data, and assure the data’s correctness through a series of follow-up questions. These follow-up questions largely overcome known issues with LLMs providing factually inaccurate responses. ChatExtract can be applied with any conversational LLMs and yields very high quality data extraction. In tests on materials data, we find precision and recall both close to 90% from the best conversational LLMs, like GPT-4. We demonstrate that the exceptional performance is enabled by the information retention in a conversational model combined with purposeful redundancy and introducing uncertainty through follow-up prompts. These results suggest that approaches similar to ChatExtract, due to their simplicity, transferability, and accuracy are likely to become powerful tools for data extraction in the near future. Finally, databases for critical cooling rates of metallic glasses and yield strengths of high entropy alloys are developed using ChatExtract.

**Abstract:**
Extracting structured knowledge from scientific text remains a challenging task for machine learning models. Here, we present a simple approach to joint named entity recognition and relation extraction and demonstrate how pretrained large language models (GPT-3, Llama-2) can be fine-tuned to extract useful records of complex scientific knowledge. We test three representative tasks in materials chemistry: linking dopants and host materials, cataloging metal-organic frameworks, and general composition/phase/morphology/application information extraction. Records are extracted from single sentences or entire paragraphs, and the output can be returned as simple English sentences or a more structured format such as a list of JSON objects. This approach represents a simple, accessible, and highly flexible route to obtaining large databases of structured specialized scientific knowledge extracted from research papers.

## 33. A Machine Learning Study on High Thermal Conductivity Assisted to Discover Chalcogenides with Balanced Infrared Nonlinear Optical Performance

**Authors:** Qingchen Wu, Lei Kang, Zheshuai Lin

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 36, Issue 6

**Pages:** 2309675

**DOI:** 10.1002/adma.202309675

**Abstract:**
Exploration of novel nonlinear optical (NLO) chalcogenides with high laser-induced damage thresholds (LIDT) is critical for mid-infrared (mid-IR) solid-state laser applications. High lattice thermal conductivity (κL) is crucial to increasing LIDT yet often neglected in the search for NLO crystals due to lack of accurate κL data. A machine learning (ML) approach to predict κL for over 6000 chalcogenides is hereby proposed. Combining ML-generated κL data and first-principles calculation, a high-throughput screening route is initiated, and ten new potential mid-IR NLO chalcogenides with optimal bandgap, NLO coefficients, and thermal conductivity are discovered, in which Li2SiS3 and AlZnGaS4 are highlighted. Big-data analysis on structural chemistry proves that the chalcogenides having dense and simple lattice structures with low anisotropy, light atoms, and strong covalent bonds are likely to possess higher κL. The four-coordinated motifs in which central cations show the bond valence sum of +2 to +3 and are from IIIA, IVA, VA, and IIB groups, such as those in diamond-like defect-chalcopyrite chalcogenides, are preferred to fulfill the desired structural chemistry conditions for balanced NLO and thermal properties. This work provides not only an efficient strategy but also interpretable research directions in the search for NLO crystals with high thermal conductivity.

A user-friendly graphical interface allows chemists without programming or machine learning expertise to easily monitor, analyze, and improve photocatalytic reactions with respect to both continuous and discrete variables. The system's effectiveness was demonstrated by increasing overall reaction yields and improving space-time yields compared with those of previously reported processes.

**Abstract:**
Machine learning holds significant research potential in the field of nanotechnology, enabling nanomaterial structure and property predictions, facilitating materials design and discovery, and reducing the need for time-consuming and labor-intensive experiments and simulations. In contrast to their achiral counterparts, the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials is still in its infancy, with a limited number of publications to date. This is despite the great potential of machine learning to advance the development of new sustainable chiral materials with high values of optical activity, circularly polarized luminescence, and enantioselectivity, as well as for the analysis of structural chirality by electron microscopy. In this review, an analysis of machine learning methods used for studying achiral nanomaterials is provided, subsequently offering guidance on adapting and extending this work to chiral nanomaterials. An overview of chiral nanomaterials within the framework of synthesis–structure–property–application relationships is presented and insights on how to leverage machine learning for the study of these highly complex relationships are provided. Some key recent publications are reviewed and discussed on the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials. Finally, the review captures the key achievements, ongoing challenges, and the prospective outlook for this very important research field.

Protein engineering has nearly limitless applications across chemistry, energy and medicine, but creating new proteins with improved or novel functions remains slow, labor-intensive and inefficient. Here we present the Self-driving Autonomous Machines for Protein Landscape Exploration (SAMPLE) platform for fully autonomous protein engineering. SAMPLE is driven by an intelligent agent that learns protein sequence–function relationships, designs new proteins and sends designs to a fully automated robotic system that experimentally tests the designed proteins and provides feedback to improve the agent’s understanding of the system. We deploy four SAMPLE agents with the goal of engineering glycoside hydrolase enzymes with enhanced thermal tolerance. Despite showing individual differences in their search behavior, all four agents quickly converge on thermostable enzymes. Self-driving laboratories automate and accelerate the scientific discovery process and hold great potential for the fields of protein engineering and synthetic biology.

**DOI:** 10.1002/adma.202306733

**Abstract:**
Combining materials science, artificial intelligence (AI), physical chemistry, and other disciplines, materials informatics is continuously accelerating the vigorous development of new materials. The emergence of “GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) AI” shows that the scientific research field has entered the era of intelligent civilization with “data” as the basic factor and “algorithm + computing power” as the core productivity. The continuous innovation of AI will impact the cognitive laws and scientific methods, and reconstruct the knowledge and wisdom system. This leads to think more about materials informatics. Here, a comprehensive discussion of AI models and materials infrastructures is provided, and the advances in the discovery and design of new materials are reviewed. With the rise of new research paradigms triggered by “AI for Science”, the vane of materials informatics: “MatGPT”, is proposed and the technical path planning from the aspects of data, descriptors, generative models, pretraining models, directed design models, collaborative training, experimental robots, as well as the efforts and preparations needed to develop a new generation of materials informatics, is carried out. Finally, the challenges and constraints faced by materials informatics are discussed, in order to achieve a more digital, intelligent, and automated construction of materials informatics with the joint efforts of more interdisciplinary scientists.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 382, Issue 6677

**Pages:** 1416-1421

**DOI:** 10.1126/science.adi2336

**Abstract:**
Global medium-range weather forecasting is critical to decision-making across many social and economic domains. Traditional numerical weather prediction uses increased compute resources to improve forecast accuracy but does not directly use historical weather data to improve the underlying model. Here, we introduce GraphCast, a machine learning–based method trained directly from reanalysis data. It predicts hundreds of weather variables for the next 10 days at 0.25° resolution globally in under 1 minute. GraphCast significantly outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems on 90% of 1380 verification targets, and its forecasts support better severe event prediction, including tropical cyclone tracking, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. GraphCast is a key advance in accurate and efficient weather forecasting and helps realize the promise of machine learning for modeling complex dynamical systems.

## 26. Data-driven analysis and prediction of stable phases for high-entropy alloy design

**Authors:** Iman Peivaste, Ericmoore Jossou, Ahmed A. Tiamiyu

**Venue:** Scientific Reports

**Publication Date:** December 18, 2023

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 13, Issue 1

**Pages:** 22556

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41598-023-50044-0

**Abstract:**
High-entropy alloys (HEAs) represent a promising class of materials with exceptional structural and functional properties. However, their design and optimization pose challenges due to the large composition-phase space coupled with the complex and diverse nature of the phase formation dynamics. In this study, a data-driven approach that utilizes machine learning (ML) techniques to predict HEA phases and their composition-dependent phases is proposed. By employing a comprehensive dataset comprising 5692 experimental records encompassing 50 elements and 11 phase categories, we compare the performance of various ML models. Our analysis identifies the most influential features for accurate phase prediction. Furthermore, the class imbalance is addressed by employing data augmentation methods, raising the number of records to 1500 in each category, and ensuring a balanced representation of phase categories. The results show that XGBoost and Random Forest consistently outperform the other models, achieving 86% accuracy in predicting all phases. Additionally, this work provides an extensive analysis of HEA phase formers, showing the contributions of elements and features to the presence of specific phases. We also examine the impact of including different phases on ML model accuracy and feature significance. Notably, the findings underscore the need for ML model selection based on specific applications and desired predictions, as feature importance varies across models and phases. This study significantly advances the understanding of HEA phase formation, enabling targeted alloy design and fostering progress in the field of materials science.

**Venue:** Nature

**Publication Date:** December 2023

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 624, Issue 7990

**Pages:** 80-85

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-023-06735-9

**Abstract:**
Novel functional materials enable fundamental breakthroughs across technological applications from clean energy to information processing1–11. From microchips to batteries and photovoltaics, discovery of inorganic crystals has been bottlenecked by expensive trial-and-error approaches. Concurrently, deep-learning models for language, vision and biology have showcased emergent predictive capabilities with increasing data and computation12–14. Here we show that graph networks trained at scale can reach unprecedented levels of generalization, improving the efficiency of materials discovery by an order of magnitude. Building on 48,000 stable crystals identified in continuing studies15–17, improved efficiency enables the discovery of 2.2 million structures below the current convex hull, many of which escaped previous human chemical intuition. Our work represents an order-of-magnitude expansion in stable materials known to humanity. Stable discoveries that are on the final convex hull will be made available to screen for technological applications, as we demonstrate for layered materials and solid-electrolyte candidates. Of the stable structures, 736 have already been independently experimentally realized. The scale and diversity of hundreds of millions of first-principles calculations also unlock modelling capabilities for downstream applications, leading in particular to highly accurate and robust learned interatomic potentials that can be used in condensed-phase molecular-dynamics simulations and high-fidelity zero-shot prediction of ionic conductivity.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 624, Issue 7990

**Pages:** 86-91

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-023-06734-w

**Abstract:**
To close the gap between the rates of computational screening and experimental realization of novel materials1,2, we introduce the A-Lab, an autonomous laboratory for the solid-state synthesis of inorganic powders. This platform uses computations, historical data from the literature, machine learning (ML) and active learning to plan and interpret the outcomes of experiments performed using robotics. Over 17 days of continuous operation, the A-Lab realized 41 novel compounds from a set of 58 targets including a variety of oxides and phosphates that were identified using large-scale ab initio phase-stability data from the Materials Project and Google DeepMind. Synthesis recipes were proposed by natural-language models trained on the literature and optimized using an active-learning approach grounded in thermodynamics. Analysis of the failed syntheses provides direct and actionable suggestions to improve current techniques for materials screening and synthesis design. The high success rate demonstrates the effectiveness of artificial-intelligence-driven platforms for autonomous materials discovery and motivates further integration of computations, historical knowledge and robotics.

**Venue:** Nature Communications

**Publication Date:** October 19, 2023

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 14, Issue 1

**Pages:** 6630

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-023-42415-y

**Abstract:**
Architected materials that consist of multiple subelements arranged in particular orders can demonstrate a much broader range of properties than their constituent materials. However, the rational design of these materials generally relies on experts’ prior knowledge and requires painstaking effort. Here, we present a data-efficient method for the high-dimensional multi-property optimization of 3D-printed architected materials utilizing a machine learning (ML) cycle consisting of the finite element method (FEM) and 3D neural networks. Specifically, we apply our method to orthopedic implant design. Compared to uniform designs, our experience-free method designs microscale heterogeneous architectures with a biocompatible elastic modulus and higher strength. Furthermore, inspired by the knowledge learned from the neural networks, we develop machine-human synergy, adapting the ML-designed architecture to fix a macroscale, irregularly shaped animal bone defect. Such adaptation exhibits 20% higher experimental load-bearing capacity than the uniform design. Thus, our method provides a data-efficient paradigm for the fast and intelligent design of architected materials with tailored mechanical, physical, and chemical properties.

## 21. ChatGPT Chemistry Assistant for Text Mining and the Prediction of MOF Synthesis

**Authors:** Zhiling Zheng, Oufan Zhang, Christian Borgs, Jennifer T. Chayes, Omar M. Yaghi

**Venue:** Journal of the American Chemical Society

**Publication Date:** August 16, 2023

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 145, Issue 32

**Pages:** 18048-18062

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.3c05819

**Abstract:**
We use prompt engineering to guide ChatGPT in the automation of text mining of metal–organic framework (MOF) synthesis conditions from diverse formats and styles of the scientific literature. This effectively mitigates ChatGPT’s tendency to hallucinate information, an issue that previously made the use of large language models (LLMs) in scientific fields challenging. Our approach involves the development of a workflow implementing three different processes for text mining, programmed by ChatGPT itself. All of them enable parsing, searching, filtering, classification, summarization, and data unification with different trade-offs among labor, speed, and accuracy. We deploy this system to extract 26 257 distinct synthesis parameters pertaining to approximately 800 MOFs sourced from peer-reviewed research articles. This process incorporates our ChemPrompt Engineering strategy to instruct ChatGPT in text mining, resulting in impressive precision, recall, and F1 scores of 90–99%. Furthermore, with the data set built by text mining, we constructed a machine-learning model with over 87% accuracy in predicting MOF experimental crystallization outcomes and preliminarily identifying important factors in MOF crystallization. We also developed a reliable data-grounded MOF chatbot to answer questions about chemical reactions and synthesis procedures. Given that the process of using ChatGPT reliably mines and tabulates diverse MOF synthesis information in a unified format while using only narrative language requiring no coding expertise, we anticipate that our ChatGPT Chemistry Assistant will be very useful across various other chemistry subdisciplines.

## 20. Enhancing corrosion-resistant alloy design through natural language processing and deep learning

**Authors:** Kasturi Narasimha Sasidhar, Nima Hamidi Siboni, Jaber Rezaei Mianroodi, Michael Rohwerder, Jörg Neugebauer, Dierk Raabe

**Venue:** Science Advances

**Publication Date:** August 11, 2023

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 9, Issue 32

**Pages:** eadg7992

**DOI:** 10.1126/sciadv.adg7992

**Abstract:**
We propose strategies that couple natural language processing with deep learning to enhance machine capability for corrosion-resistant alloy design. First, accuracy of machine learning models for materials datasets is often limited by their inability to incorporate textual data. Manual extraction of numerical parameters from descriptions of alloy processing or experimental methodology inevitably leads to a reduction in information density. To overcome this, we have developed a fully automated natural language processing approach to transform textual data into a form compatible for feeding into a deep neural network. This approach has resulted in a pitting potential prediction accuracy substantially beyond state of the art. Second, we have implemented a deep learning model with a transformed-input feature space, consisting of a set of elemental physical/chemical property–based numerical descriptors of alloys replacing alloy compositions. This helped identification of those descriptors that are most critical toward enhancing their pitting potential. In particular, configurational entropy, atomic packing efficiency, local electronegativity differences, and atomic radii differences proved to be the most critical.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 14, Issue 1

**Pages:** 4607

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-023-40282-1

**Abstract:**
Porous carbons are the active materials of choice for supercapacitor applications because of their power capability, long-term cycle stability, and wide operating temperatures. However, the development of carbon active materials with improved physicochemical and electrochemical properties is generally carried out via time-consuming and cost-ineffective experimental processes. In this regard, machine-learning technology provides a data-driven approach to examine previously reported research works to find the critical features for developing ideal carbon materials for supercapacitors. Here, we report the design of a machine-learning-derived activation strategy that uses sodium amide and cross-linked polymer precursors to synthesize highly porous carbons (i.e., with specific surface areas > 4000 m2/g). Tuning the pore size and oxygen content of the carbonaceous materials, we report a highly porous carbon-base electrode with 0.7 mg/cm2 of electrode mass loading that exhibits a high specific capacitance of 610 F/g in 1 M H2SO4. This result approaches the specific capacitance of a porous carbon electrode predicted by the machine learning approach. We also investigate the charge storage mechanism and electrolyte transport properties via step potential electrochemical spectroscopy and quasielastic neutron scattering measurements.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 9, Issue 19

**Pages:** eadf9931

**DOI:** 10.1126/sciadv.adf9931

**Abstract:**
High-entropy alloy (HEA) nanocrystals have attracted extensive attention in catalysis. However, there are no effective strategies for synthesizing them in a controllable and predictable manner. With quinary HEA nanocrystals made of platinum-group metals as an example, we demonstrate that their structures with spatial compositions can be predicted by quantitatively knowing the reduction kinetics of metal precursors and entropy of mixing in the nanocrystals under dropwise addition of the mixing five–metal precursor solution. The time to reach a steady state for each precursor plays a pivotal role in determining the structures of HEA nanocrystals with homogeneous alloy and core-shell features. Compared to the commercial platinum/carbon and phase-separated counterparts, the dendritic HEA nanocrystals with a defect-rich surface show substantial enhancement in catalytic activity and durability toward both hydrogen evolution and oxidation. This quantitative study will lead to a paradigm shift in the design of HEA nanocrystals, pushing away from the trial-and-error approach.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 617, Issue 7960

**Pages:** 292-298

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-023-05898-9

**Abstract:**
The development of new materials and their compositional and microstructural optimization are essential in regard to next-generation technologies such as clean energy and environmental sustainability. However, materials discovery and optimization have been a frustratingly slow process. The Edisonian trial-and-error process is time consuming and resource inefficient, particularly when contrasted with vast materials design spaces1. Whereas traditional combinatorial deposition methods can generate material libraries2,3, these suffer from limited material options and inability to leverage major breakthroughs in nanomaterial synthesis. Here we report a high-throughput combinatorial printing method capable of fabricating materials with compositional gradients at microscale spatial resolution. In situ mixing and printing in the aerosol phase allows instantaneous tuning of the mixing ratio of a broad range of materials on the fly, which is an important feature unobtainable in conventional multimaterials printing using feedstocks in liquid–liquid or solid–solid phases4–6. We demonstrate a variety of high-throughput printing strategies and applications in combinatorial doping, functional grading and chemical reaction, enabling materials exploration of doped chalcogenides and compositionally graded materials with gradient properties. The ability to combine the top-down design freedom of additive manufacturing with bottom-up control over local material compositions promises the development of compositionally complex materials inaccessible via conventional manufacturing approaches.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41524-023-01003-w

**Abstract:**
The ever-increasing number of materials science articles makes it hard to infer chemistry-structure-property relations from literature. We used natural language processing methods to automatically extract material property data from the abstracts of polymer literature. As a component of our pipeline, we trained MaterialsBERT, a language model, using 2.4 million materials science abstracts, which outperforms other baseline models in three out of five named entity recognition datasets. Using this pipeline, we obtained ~300,000 material property records from ~130,000 abstracts in 60 hours. The extracted data was analyzed for a diverse range of applications such as fuel cells, supercapacitors, and polymer solar cells to recover non-trivial insights. The data extracted through our pipeline is made available at polymerscholar.orgwhich can be used to locate material property data recorded in abstracts. This work demonstrates the feasibility of an automatic pipeline that starts from published literature and ends with extracted material property information.

**Abstract:**
Recent advances in machine learning have leveraged evolutionary information in multiple sequence alignments to predict protein structure. We demonstrate direct inference of full atomic-level protein structure from primary sequence using a large language model. As language models of protein sequences are scaled up to 15 billion parameters, an atomic-resolution picture of protein structure emerges in the learned representations. This results in an order-of-magnitude acceleration of high-resolution structure prediction, which enables large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins. We apply this capability to construct the ESM Metagenomic Atlas by predicting structures for >617 million metagenomic protein sequences, including >225 million that are predicted with high confidence, which gives a view into the vast breadth and diversity of natural proteins.

**DOI:** 10.1126/science.abo4940

**Abstract:**
High-entropy alloys are solid solutions of multiple principal elements that are capable of reaching composition and property regimes inaccessible for dilute materials. Discovering those with valuable properties, however, too often relies on serendipity, because thermodynamic alloy design rules alone often fail in high-dimensional composition spaces. We propose an active learning strategy to accelerate the design of high-entropy Invar alloys in a practically infinite compositional space based on very sparse data. Our approach works as a closed-loop, integrating machine learning with density-functional theory, thermodynamic calculations, and experiments. After processing and characterizing 17 new alloys out of millions of possible compositions, we identified two high-entropy Invar alloys with extremely low thermal expansion coefficients around 2 × 10−6 per degree kelvin at 300 kelvin. We believe this to be a suitable pathway for the fast and automated discovery of high-entropy alloys with optimal thermal, magnetic, and electrical properties.

**Abstract:**
DeepMind presented notably accurate predictions at the recent 14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14) conference. We explored network architectures that incorporate related ideas and obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the one-dimensional (1D) sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2

**Abstract:**
Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 12, Issue 1

**Pages:** 2276

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-021-22518-0

**Abstract:**
Deep Learning (DL) methods are powerful analytical tools for microscopy and can outperform conventional image processing pipelines. Despite the enthusiasm and innovations fuelled by DL technology, the need to access powerful and compatible resources to train DL networks leads to an accessibility barrier that novice users often find difficult to overcome. Here, we present ZeroCostDL4Mic, an entry-level platform simplifying DL access by leveraging the free, cloud-based computational resources of Google Colab. ZeroCostDL4Mic allows researchers with no coding expertise to train and apply key DL networks to perform tasks including segmentation (using U-Net and StarDist), object detection (using YOLOv2), denoising (using CARE and Noise2Void), super-resolution microscopy (using Deep-STORM), and image-to-image translation (using Label-free prediction - fnet, pix2pix and CycleGAN). Importantly, we provide suitable quantitative tools for each network to evaluate model performance, allowing model optimisation. We demonstrate the application of the platform to study multiple biological processes.

**Venue:** Reviews of Modern Physics

**Publication Date:** December 06, 2019

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 91, Issue 4

**Pages:** 045002

**DOI:** 10.1103/RevModPhys.91.045002

**Abstract:**
Machine learning encompasses a broad range of algorithms and modeling tools used for a vast array of data processing tasks, which has entered most scientific disciplines in recent years. We review in a selective way the recent research on the interface between machine learning and physical sciences. This includes conceptual developments in machine learning (ML) motivated by physical insights, applications of machine learning techniques to several domains in physics, and cross-fertilization between the two fields. After giving basic notion of machine learning methods and principles, we describe examples of how statistical physics is used to understand methods in ML. We then move to describe applications of ML methods in particle physics and cosmology, quantum many body physics, quantum computing, and chemical and material physics. We also highlight research and development into novel computing architectures aimed at accelerating ML. In each of the sections we describe recent successes as well as domain-specific methodology and challenges.

## 1. Accelerated discovery of metallic glasses through iteration of machine learning and high-throughput experiments

**Authors:** Fang Ren, Logan Ward, Travis Williams, Kevin J. Laws, Christopher Wolverton, Jason Hattrick-Simpers, Apurva Mehta

**Venue:** Science Advances

**Publication Date:** April 13, 2018

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 4, Issue 4

**Pages:** eaaq1566

**DOI:** 10.1126/sciadv.aaq1566

**Abstract:**
With more than a hundred elements in the periodic table, a large number of potential new materials exist to address the technological and societal challenges we face today; however, without some guidance, searching through this vast combinatorial space is frustratingly slow and expensive, especially for materials strongly influenced by processing. We train a machine learning (ML) model on previously reported observations, parameters from physiochemical theories, and make it synthesis method–dependent to guide high-throughput (HiTp) experiments to find a new system of metallic glasses in the Co-V-Zr ternary. Experimental observations are in good agreement with the predictions of the model, but there are quantitative discrepancies in the precise compositions predicted. We use these discrepancies to retrain the ML model. The refined model has significantly improved accuracy not only for the Co-V-Zr system but also across all other available validation data. We then use the refined model to guide the discovery of metallic glasses in two additional previously unreported ternaries. Although our approach of iterative use of ML and HiTp experiments has guided us to rapid discovery of three new glass-forming systems, it has also provided us with a quantitatively accurate, synthesis method–sensitive predictor for metallic glasses that improves performance with use and thus promises to greatly accelerate discovery of many new metallic glasses. We believe that this discovery paradigm is applicable to a wider range of materials and should prove equally powerful for other materials and properties that are synthesis path–dependent and that current physiochemical theories find challenging to predict.
