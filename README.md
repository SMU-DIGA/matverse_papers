### 170. Supervised learning in DNA neural networks

**Authors:** Kevin M. Cherry, Lulu Qian

**Venue:** Nature

**Publication Date:** September 03, 2025

**Pages:** 1-9

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-025-09479-w

**Abstract:**
Learning enables biological organisms to begin life simple yet develop immensely diverse and complex behaviours. Understanding learning principles in engineered molecular systems could enable us to endow non-living physical systems with similar capabilities. Inspired by how the brain processes information, the principles of neural computation have been developed over the past 80 years1, forming the foundation of modern machine learning. More than four decades ago, connections between neural computation and physical systems were established2. More recently, synthetic molecular systems, including nucleic acid and protein circuits, have been investigated for their abilities to implement neural computation3–7. However, in these systems, learning of molecular parameters such as concentrations and reaction rates was performed in silico to generate desired input–output functions. Here we show that DNA molecules can be programmed to autonomously carry out supervised learning in vitro, with the system learning to perform pattern classification from molecular examples of inputs and desired responses. We demonstrate a DNA neural network trained to classify three different sets of 100-bit patterns, integrating training data directly into memories of molecular concentrations and using these memories to process subsequent test data. Our work suggests that molecular circuits can learn tasks more complex than simple adaptive behaviours. This opens the door to molecular machines capable of embedded learning and decision-making in a wide range of physical systems, from biomedicine to soft materials.

### 166. Generalizable descriptors for automatic titanium alloys design by learning from texts via large language model

**Authors:** Ping Wang, Yuan Jiang, Weijie Liao, Rong Wang, Minjie Lai, Hongchao Kou, Xiubing Liang, Jinshan Li, Turab Lookman, Ruihao Yuan

**Venue:** Acta Materialia

**Publication Date:** September 01, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 296

**Pages:** 121275

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.actamat.2025.121275

**Abstract:**
Descriptors are essential prerequisites for the success of machine learning-based materials design. However, the automatic construction of generalizable descriptors for various properties, together with their integration with design criteria, remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we overcome this obstacle by devising a framework that integrates large language model, domain theory constraints ([Mo]eq and d-electron theory), and multi-objective global optimization. This framework fuses structured (tabular composition/processing) and unstructured (texts) data to obtain enriched descriptors and facilitate materials design. Using titanium alloys as model case, we first automatically achieve descriptors that generalize well across a variety of properties for optimized prediction models. With which a design pipeline is proposed, several alloys with high promise for enhanced competing properties are identified from a vast chemical and processing space, and their reliability is validated via experimental synthesis. It is revealed that the enriched descriptors, learned from ∼ 50,000 texts without apparent physics, capture expertise related to phase stability, alloying rules for specific properties, and more. Our proposed approach can be applied to the design of other materials where descriptors are currently inadequate and structured data availability is limited.

### 165. Digital Twin for Chemical Science: a case study on water interactions on the Ag(111) surface

**Authors:** Jin Qian, Asmita Jana, Siddarth Menon, Andrew E. Bogdan, Rebecca Hamlyn, Johannes Mahl, Ethan J. Crumlin

**Venue:** Nature Computational Science

**Publication Date:** August 27, 2025

**Pages:** 1-8

**DOI:** 10.1038/s43588-025-00857-y

**Abstract:**
Directly visualizing chemical trajectories offers insights into catalysis, gas-phase reactions and photoinduced dynamics. Tracking the transformation of chemical species is best achieved by coupling theory and experiment. Here we developed Digital Twin for Chemical Science (DTCS) v.01, which integrates theory, experiment and their bidirectional feedback loops into a unified platform for chemical characterization. DTCS addresses a core question: given a set of experimental conditions, what is the expected outcome and why? It consists of a forward solver that takes a chemical reaction network and predicts spectra under experimental conditions, and an inverse solver that infers kinetics from measured spectra. We applied DTCS to ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of the Ag–H2O interface as an example. This approach enables real-time knowledge extraction and guides experiments until a stopping condition is met based on accuracy and degeneracy. As a step toward autonomous chemical characterization, DTCS provides mechanistic knowledge in a verified, standardized manner.

### 163. An automated framework for exploring and learning potential-energy surfaces

**Authors:** Yuanbin Liu, Joe D. Morrow, Christina Ertural, Natascia L. Fragapane, John L. A. Gardner, Aakash A. Naik, Yuxing Zhou, Janine George, Volker L. Deringer

**Venue:** Nature Communications

**Publication Date:** August 18, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 16, Issue 1

**Pages:** 7666

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-62510-6

**Abstract:**
Machine learning has become ubiquitous in materials modelling and now routinely enables large-scale atomistic simulations with quantum-mechanical accuracy. However, developing machine-learned interatomic potentials requires high-quality training data, and the manual generation and curation of such data can be a major bottleneck. Here, we introduce an automated framework for the exploration and fitting of potential-energy surfaces, implemented in an openly available software package that we call autoplex (‘automatic potential-landscape explorer’). We discuss design choices, particularly the interoperability with existing software architectures, and the ability for the end user to easily use the computational workflows provided. We show wide-ranging capability demonstrations: for the titanium–oxygen system, SiO2, crystalline and liquid water, as well as phase-change memory materials. More generally, our study illustrates how automation can speed up atomistic machine learning in computational materials science.

**Publication Date:** August 15, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 11, Issue 33

**Pages:** eadx2299

**DOI:** 10.1126/sciadv.adx2299

**Abstract:**
Finding the optimal dimensions of metal nanoparticles to maximize their plasmonic performance in targeted applications is a complex and time-consuming process that typically requires a trial-and-error approach. Here, we propose a universal pipeline that integrates Bayesian optimization with electrodynamics simulations to find dimensions of gold bipyramids with superior plasmonic performance in photothermal efficiency, enhancement of Raman scattering and photoluminescence, strong coupling between plasmon and exciton, and aggregation-induced color difference. Our workflow is a straightforward tool for plasmonic nanoparticle design, setting their optimal dimensions for targeted applications.

### 161. Data-driven de novo design of super-adhesive hydrogels

**Authors:** Hongguang Liao, Sheng Hu, Hu Yang, Lei Wang, Shinya Tanaka, Ichigaku Takigawa, Wei Li, Hailong Fan, Jian Ping Gong

**Venue:** Nature

**Publication Date:** August 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 644, Issue 8075

**Pages:** 89-95

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-025-09269-4

**Abstract:**
Data-driven methodologies have transformed the discovery and prediction of hard materials with well-defined atomic structures by leveraging standardized datasets, enabling accurate property predictions and facilitating efficient exploration of design spaces1–3. However, their application to soft materials remains challenging because of complex, multiscale structure–property relationships4–6. Here we present a data-driven approach that integrates data mining, experimentation and machine learning to design high-performance adhesive hydrogels from scratch, tailored for demanding underwater environments. By leveraging protein databases, we developed a descriptor strategy to statistically replicate protein sequence patterns in polymer strands by ideal random copolymerization, enabling targeted hydrogel design and dataset construction. Using machine learning, we optimized hydrogel formulations from an initial dataset of 180 bioinspired hydrogels, achieving remarkable improvements in adhesive strength, with a maximum value exceeding 1 MPa. These super-adhesive hydrogels hold immense potential across diverse applications, from biomedical engineering to deep-sea exploration, marking a notable advancement in data-driven innovation for soft materials.

### 159. Deep learning for property prediction of natural fiber polymer composites

**Authors:** Ivan P. Malashin, Dmitry Martysyuk, Vladimir Nelyub, Aleksei Borodulin, Andrei Gantimurov, Vadim Tynchenko

**Venue:** Scientific Reports

**Publication Date:** July 30, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 27837

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41598-025-10841-1

**Abstract:**
The increasing availability of diverse experimental and computational data has accelerated the application of deep learning (DL) techniques for predicting polymer properties. A literature review was conducted to show recent advances in DL applied to this field. For example, Li et al. (2023) achieved an $$R^2>0.96$$for predicting stiffness tensors of carbon fiber composites using a hybrid CNN–MLP model trained on microstructure images and two-point statistics. Aligning with this approach, Xue et al. (2023) compared DNN performance with genetic programming and minimax probability machine regression in predicting the lateral confinement coefficient for CFRP-wrapped RC columns, showing competitive predictive capability. These studies demonstrate that specialized architectures, including hybrid CNN–MLP models, feedforward ANNs, graph convolutional networks, and DNNs, provide high accuracy in predicting mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties of polymer composites and biodegradable plastics. Among these, DNNs have consistently shown superior performance in capturing complex nonlinear relationships within heterogeneous datasets, highlighting their suitability for materials characterization and optimization tasks. Building on these insights, this study investigates the effects of four natural fibers (flax, cotton, sisal, hemp) with densities around 1.48–1.54 g/cm$$^3$$, incorporated at 30 wt.% into three polymer matrices (PLA, PP, epoxy resin) with varying surface treatments (untreated, alkaline, silane). Samples were prepared via extrusion and injection molding (or casting for epoxy) under controlled processing conditions. Mechanical properties (tensile strength, modulus, elongation at break, impact toughness) were measured per ASTM standards, and density was determined by Archimedes’ method. Using 180 experimental samples, augmented up to 1500 using bootstrap technique, several regression models–linear, random forest, gradient boosting, DNNs–were developed to predict mechanical behavior. Best DNN model architecture (four hidden layers (128–64–32–16 neurons), ReLU activation, 20% dropout, a batch size of 64, and the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of $$10^{-3}$$) obtained through hyperparameter optimization using Optuna, delivered the best performance (R$$^2$$up to 0.89) and MAE reductions of 9–12% compared to gradient boosting, driven by the DNN’s ability to capture nonlinear synergies between fiber-matrix interactions, surface treatments, and processing parameters while aligning architectural complexity with multiscale material behavior.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 147, Issue 27

**Pages:** 23367-23380

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.5c08214

**Abstract:**
After the development of the famous “Transformer” network architecture and the meteoric rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots, large language models (LLMs) have become an indispensable part of our daily activities. In this rapidly evolving era, “all we need is attention” as Google’s famous transformer paper’s title [Vaswani et al., Adv. Neural Inf. Process. Syst. 2017, 30] implies: We need to focus on and give “attention” to what we have at hand, then consider what we can do further. What can LLMs offer for immediate short-term adaptation? Currently, the most common applications in metal–organic framework (MOF) research include automating literature reviews and data extraction to accelerate the material discovery process. In this perspective, we discuss the latest developments in machine-learning and deep-learning research on MOF materials and reflect on how their utilization has evolved within the LLM domain from this standpoint. We finally explore future benefits to accelerate and automate materials development research.

### 154. Natural-Language-Interfaced Robotic Synthesis for AI-Copilot-Assisted Exploration of Inorganic Materials

**Authors:** Lin Huang, Chao Zhang, Yun Fu, Yibin Jiang, Enyu He, Ming-Qiang Qi, Ming-Hao Du, Xiang-Jian Kong, Jun Cheng, Leroy Cronin, Cheng Wang

**Venue:** Journal of the American Chemical Society

**Publication Date:** July 02, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 147, Issue 26

**Pages:** 23014-23025

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.5c05916

**Abstract:**
The automation of chemical synthesis presents opportunities to enhance experimental reproducibility and accelerate discovery. Traditional closed-loop approaches, while effective in specific domains, are often constrained by rigid workflows and the requirement for specialized expertise. Here, we introduce a chemical robotic explorer integrated with an artificial intelligence (AI) copilot to enable a more flexible and adaptive synthesis, simplifying the process from inspiration to experimentation. This modular platform uses a large language model (LLM) to map natural language synthetic descriptions to executable unit operations, including temperature control, stirring, liquid and solid handling, filtration, etc. By integrating AI-driven literature searches, real-time experimental design, conversational human–AI interaction, and feedback-based optimization, we demonstrate the capabilities of AI in successfully synthesizing 13 compounds across four distinct classes of inorganic materials: coordination complexes, metal–organic frameworks, nanoparticles, and polyoxometalates. Notably, this approach enabled the discovery of a previously unreported family of Mn–W polyoxometalate clusters, showing the potential of AI-enhanced robotics as a generalizable and adaptable platform for material innovation.

**Abstract:**
Carrier biomaterials used in single-cell analysis face a bottleneck in protein detection sensitivity, primarily attributed to elevated false positives caused by nonspecific protein adsorption. Toward carrier biomaterials with ultra-low nonspecific protein adsorption, a self-evolving discovery is developed to address the challenge of high-dimensional parameter spaces. Automation across nine self-developed or modified workstations is integrated to achieve a “can-do” capability, and develop a synergy-enhanced Bayesian optimization algorithm as the artificial intelligence brain to enable a “can-think” capability for small-data problems inherent to time-consuming biological experiments, thereby establishing a self-evolving discovery for carrier biomaterials. Through this approach, carrier biomaterials with an ultra-low nonspecific protein adsorption index of 0.2537 are successfully discovered, representing an over 80% decrease, while achieving a 10 000-fold reduction in experiment workload. Furthermore, the discovered biomaterials are fabricated into microfluidic-used carriers for protein-analysis applications, showing a 9-fold enhancement in detection sensitivity compared to conventional carriers. This is the very demonstration of a self-evolving discovery for carrier biomaterials, paving the way for advancements in single-cell protein analysis and further its integration with genomics and transcriptomics.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-61209-y

**Abstract:**
Proteins are the molecular machines of life with numerous applications in energy, health, and sustainability. However, engineering proteins with desired functions for practical applications remains slow, expensive, and specialist-dependent. Here we report a generally applicable platform for autonomous enzyme engineering that integrates machine learning and large language models with biofoundry automation to eliminate the need for human intervention, judgement, and domain expertise. Requiring only an input protein sequence and a quantifiable way to measure fitness, this automated platform can be applied to engineer a wide array of proteins. As a proof of concept, we engineer Arabidopsis thaliana halide methyltransferase (AtHMT) for a 90-fold improvement in substrate preference and 16-fold improvement in ethyltransferase activity, along with developing a Yersinia mollaretii phytase (YmPhytase) variant with 26-fold improvement in activity at neutral pH. This is accomplished in four rounds over 4 weeks, while requiring construction and characterization of fewer than 500 variants for each enzyme. This platform for autonomous experimentation paves the way for rapid advancements across diverse industries, from medicine and biotechnology to renewable energy and sustainable chemistry.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 643, Issue 8070

**Pages:** 119-124

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-025-09160-2

**Abstract:**
The pursuit of strong yet ductile alloys has been ongoing for centuries. However, for all alloys developed thus far, including recent high-entropy alloys, those possessing good tensile ductility rarely approach 2-GPa yield strength at room temperature. The few that do are mostly ultra-strong steels1–3; however, their stress–strain curves exhibit plateaus and serrations because their tensile flow suffers from plastic instability (such as Lüders strains)1–4, and the elongation is pseudo-uniform at best. Here we report that a group of carefully engineered multi-principal-element alloys, with a composition of Fe35Ni29Co21Al12Ta3 designed by means of domain knowledge-informed machine learning, can be processed to reach an unprecedented range of simultaneously high strength and ductility. An example of this synergy delivers 1.8-GPa yield strength combined with 25% truly uniform elongation. We achieved strengthening by pushing microstructural heterogeneities to the extreme through unusually large volume fractions of not only coherent L12 nanoprecipitates but also incoherent B2 microparticles. The latter, being multicomponent with a reduced chemical ordering energy, is a deformable phase that accumulates dislocations inside to help sustain a high strain hardening rate that prolongs uniform elongation.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41524-025-01674-7

**Abstract:**
Automating structured data extraction from scientific literature is a critical challenge with broad implications across domains. We introduce nanoMINER, a multi-agent system combining large language models and multimodal analysis to extract essential information from scientific research articles on nanomaterials. This system processes documents end-to-end, utilizing tools such as YOLO for visual data extraction and GPT-4o for linking textual and visual information. At its core, the ReAct agent orchestrates specialized agents to ensure comprehensive data extraction. We demonstrate the efficacy of the system by automating the assembly of nanomaterial and nanozyme datasets previously manually curated by domain experts. NanoMINER achieves high precision in extracting nanomaterial properties like chemical formulas, crystal systems, and surface characteristics. For nanozymes, we obtain near-perfect precision (0.98) for kinetic parameters and essential features such as Cmin and Cmax. To benchmark the system performance, we also compare nanoMINER to several baseline LLMs, including the most recent multimodal GPT-4.1, and show consistently higher extraction precision and recall. Our approach is extensible to other domains of materials science and fields like biomedicine, advancing data-driven research methodologies and automated knowledge extraction.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-60514-w

**Abstract:**
Self-driving laboratories (SDLs), powered by robotics, automation and artificial intelligence, accelerate scientific discoveries through autonomous experimentation. However, their adoption and transferability are limited by the lack of standardized software across diverse SDLs. In this work, we introduce IvoryOS – an open-source orchestrator that automatically generates web interfaces for Python-based SDLs. It ensures interoperability by dynamically updating the user interfaces with the plugged components and their functionalities. The interfaces enable users to directly control SDLs and design workflows through a drag-and-drop user interface. Additionally, the workflow manager provides no-code configuration for iterative execution, supporting both human-in-the-loop and closed-loop experimentation. We demonstrate the integration of IvoryOS with six SDLs across two institutes, showcasing its adaptability and utility across platforms at various development stages. The plug-and-play and low-code feature of IvoryOS addresses the rapidly evolving demands of SDL development and significantly lowers the barrier to entry for building and managing SDLs.

### 142. A novel training-free approach to efficiently extracting material microstructures via visual large model

**Authors:** Changtai Li, Xu Han, Chao Yao, Yu Guo, Zixin Li, Lei Jiang, Wei Liu, Haiyou Huang, Huadong Fu, Xiaojuan Ban

**Venue:** Acta Materialia

**Publication Date:** May 15, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 290

**Pages:** 120962

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.actamat.2025.120962

**Abstract:**
The precise quantitative description of material microstructures is essential for deeply exploring the relationship between material composition and property. This significant understanding efficiently enables composition design, process optimization, and property enhancement. Traditionally, the analysis of material microstructures has relied heavily on professional expertise. Even with machine /deep learning (ML/DL)-based analysis methods, substantial expert annotation is required for training, and the trained models often suffer from weak generalizability and poor recognition of new images. This study proposed MatSAM (Materials Segment Anything Model), a novel training-free approach for efficient material microstructure extraction based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a type of visual large model (VLM). Integrating region marking and microscopy-adapted points, an automated point-based prompt strategy was developed to achieve accurate and efficient material microstructure recognition. Without any manual annotations, MatSAM precisely identified 11 kinds of metallic material microstructures obtained through various characterization methods. Compared to optimal conventional rule-based methods that do not involve a learning process (non-ML/DL), MatSAM achieved an average relative improvement of 35.4 % in metrics combining the adjusted Rand index (ARI) and Intersection over Union (IoU), outperforming the original SAM by an average of 13.9 %. On four public microstructure segmentation datasets, the IoU of MatSAM showed an average improvement of 7.5 % over corresponding specialist deep models requiring annotations. Meanwhile, MatSAM satisfied the generalization capability of a single model for various microstructures, including grain boundaries, phases, and defects. This approach significantly reduces the labor and computational costs of quantitatively characterizing material microstructures, further accelerating the development of advanced materials.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 16, Issue 1

**Pages:** 4379

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-59636-y

**Abstract:**
The vastness of chemical space presents a long-standing challenge for the exploration of new compounds with pre-determined properties. In materials science, crystal structure prediction has become a mature tool for mapping from composition to structure based on global optimisation techniques. Generative artificial intelligence now offers the means to efficiently navigate larger regions of crystal chemical space informed by structure-property datasets of materials. Here, we introduce a model, named Chemeleon, designed to generate chemical compositions and crystal structures by learning from both textual descriptions and three-dimensional structural data. The model employs denoising diffusion techniques for compound generation using textual inputs aligned with structural data via cross-modal contrastive learning. The potential of this approach is demonstrated for multi-component compound generation, including the Zn-Ti-O ternary space, and the prediction of stable phases in the Li-P-S-Cl quaternary space of relevance to solid-state batteries.

### 140. Using GNN property predictors as molecule generators

**Authors:** Félix Therrien, Edward H. Sargent, Oleksandr Voznyy

**Venue:** Nature Communications

**Publication Date:** May 08, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 16, Issue 1

**Pages:** 4301

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-59439-1

**Abstract:**
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools to accurately predict materials and molecular properties in computational and automated discovery pipelines. In this article, we exploit the invertible nature of these neural networks to directly generate molecular structures with desired electronic properties. Starting from a random graph or an existing molecule, we perform a gradient ascent while holding the GNN weights fixed in order to optimize its input, the molecular graph, towards the target property. Valence rules are enforced strictly through a judicious graph construction. The method relies entirely on the property predictor; no additional training is required on molecular structures. We demonstrate the application of this method by generating molecules with specific energy gaps verified with density functional theory (DFT) and with specific octanol-water partition coefficients (logP). Our approach hits target properties with rates comparable to or better than state-of-the-art generative models while consistently generating more diverse molecules. Moreover, while validating our framework we created a dataset of 1617 new molecules and their corresponding DFT-calculated properties that could serve as an out-of-distribution test set for QM9-trained models.

**Pages:** 1172-1179

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-025-08897-0

**Abstract:**
Weather prediction is critical for a range of human activities, including transportation, agriculture and industry, as well as for the safety of the general public. Machine learning transforms numerical weather prediction (NWP) by replacing the numerical solver with neural networks, improving the speed and accuracy of the forecasting component of the prediction pipeline1–6. However, current models rely on numerical systems at initialization and to produce local forecasts, thereby limiting their achievable gains. Here we show that a single machine learning model can replace the entire NWP pipeline. Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end data-driven weather prediction system, ingests observations and produces global gridded forecasts and local station forecasts. The global forecasts outperform an operational NWP baseline for several variables and lead times. The local station forecasts are skilful for up to ten days of lead time, competing with a post-processed global NWP baseline and a state-of-the-art end-to-end forecasting system with input from human forecasters. End-to-end tuning further improves the accuracy of local forecasts. Our results show that skilful forecasting is possible without relying on NWP at deployment time, which will enable the realization of the full speed and accuracy benefits of data-driven models. We believe that Aardvark Weather will be the starting point for a new generation of end-to-end models that will reduce computational costs by orders of magnitude and enable the rapid, affordable creation of customized models for a range of end users.

**Abstract:**
Thermoelectric materials have the ability to convert waste heat into electricity, offering a valuable solution for energy harvesting. However, their widespread use is hindered by low conversion efficiency, the reliance on expensive rare earth elements, and the environmental and regulatory concerns associated with lead-based materials. A fast and cost-effective way to identify highly efficient thermoelectric materials is through data-driven methods. These approaches rely on robust and comprehensive datasets to train models. Although there are several databases on thermoelectric materials, there is still a need to collect and integrate experimental data from peer-reviewed research articles to capture diverse compositions and properties of materials. Here we developed a comprehensive database of 7,123 thermoelectric compounds, containing key information such as chemical composition, structural detail, seebeck coefficient, electrical and thermal conductivity, power factor, and figure of merit (ZT). We used the GPTArticleExtractor workflow, powered by large language models (LLM), to extract and curate data automatically from the scientific literature published in Elsevier journals. This process enabled the creation of a structured database that addresses the challenges of manual data collection. The open access database could stimulate data-driven research and advance thermoelectric material analysis and discovery.

**Abstract:**
The scalable synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) materials remains a key challenge for their integration into solid-state technology. While exfoliation techniques have driven much of the scientific progress, they are impractical for large-scale applications. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) now offer new strategies for materials synthesis. This study explores the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) trained via evolutionary methods to optimize graphene growth. The ANN autonomously refines a time-dependent synthesis protocol without prior knowledge of effective recipes. The evaluation is based on Raman spectroscopy, where outcomes resembling monolayer graphene receive higher scores. This feedback mechanism enables iterative improvements in synthesis conditions, progressively enhancing sample quality. By integrating AI-driven optimization into material synthesis, this work contributes to the development of scalable approaches for 2D materials, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in guiding experimental processes.

**Publication Date:** April 17, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 16, Issue 1

**Pages:** 3687

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-58522-x

**Abstract:**
All-solid-state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) promise superior safety and energy density compared to conventional Li-ion batteries. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by detrimental interfacial reactions between solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) and the Li negative electrode, compromising long-term cycling stability. The challenges in directly observing these interfaces impede a comprehensive understanding of reaction mechanisms, necessitating first-principle simulations for designing novel interlayer materials. To overcome these limitations, we develop a database-supported high-throughput screening (DSHTS) framework for identifying stable interlayer materials compatible with both Li and SSEs. Using Li3InCl6 as a model SSE, we identify Li3OCl as a potential interlayer material. Experimental validation demonstrates significantly improved electrochemical performance in both symmetric- and full-cell configurations. A Li|Li3OCl|Li3InCl6|LiCoO2 cell exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 154.4 mAh/g (1.09 mA/cm2, 2.5–4.2 V vs. Li/Li+, 303 K) with 76.36% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. Notably, a cell with a conventional In-Li6PS5Cl interlayer delivers only 132.4 mAh/g and fails after 760 cycles. An additional interlayer-containing battery with Li(Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1)O2 as the positive electrode achieves an initial discharge capacity of 151.3 mAh/g (3.84 mA/cm2, 2.5–4.2 V vs. Li/Li+, 303 K), maintaining stable operation over 1650 cycles. The results demonstrate the promise of the DSHTS framework for identifying interlayer materials.

We demonstrate its versatility and efficacy through six experimental tasks of varying complexity, ranging from straightforward synthesis and characterization to more complex exploration and screening of experimental parameters, culminating in the discovery and optimization of functional materials. Additionally, we introduce a seventh task, where ChemAgents is deployed in a new robotic chemistry lab environment to autonomously perform photocatalytic organic reactions, highlighting ChemAgents’s scalability and adaptability.

**Abstract:**
Developing advanced catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for sustainable hydrogen production. This study presents a multistage machine learning (ML) approach to streamline the discovery and optimization of complex multimetallic catalysts. Our method integrates data mining, active learning, and domain adaptation throughout the materials discovery process. Unlike traditional trial-and-error methods, this approach systematically narrows the exploration space using domain knowledge with minimized reliance on subjective intuition. Then, the active learning module efficiently refines element composition and synthesis conditions through iterative experimental feedback. The process culminated in the discovery of a promising Ru-Mn-Ca-Pr oxide catalyst.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 639, Issue 8055

**Pages:** 624-632

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-025-08628-5

**Abstract:**
The design of functional materials with desired properties is essential in driving technological advances in areas such as energy storage, catalysis and carbon capture1–3. Generative models accelerate materials design by directly generating new materials given desired property constraints, but current methods have a low success rate in proposing stable crystals or can satisfy only a limited set of property constraints4–11. Here we present MatterGen, a model that generates stable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further be fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property constraints. Compared with previous generative models4,12, structures produced by MatterGen are more than twice as likely to be new and stable, and more than ten times closer to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully generates stable, new materials with desired chemistry, symmetry and mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. As a proof of concept, we synthesize one of the generated structures and measure its property value to be within 20% of our target. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of abilities of MatterGen represent an important advancement towards creating a foundational generative model for materials design.

### 124. Developing novel low-density high-entropy superalloys with high strength and superior creep resistance guided by automated machine learning

**Authors:** Yancheng Li, Jingyu Pang, Zhen Li, Qing Wang, Zhenhua Wang, Jinlin Li, Hongwei Zhang, Zengbao Jiao, Chuang Dong, Peter K. Liaw

**Venue:** Acta Materialia

**Publication Date:** February 15, 2025

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 285

**Pages:** 120656

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.actamat.2024.120656

**Abstract:**
Design of novel superalloys with low density, high strength, and great microstructural stability is a big challenge. This work used an automated machine learning (ML) model to explore high-entropy superalloys (HESAs) with coherent γ' nanoprecipitates in the FCC-γ matrix. The database samples were firstly preprocessed via the domain-knowledge before ML. Both autogluon and genetic algorithm methods were applied to establish the relationship between the alloy composition and yield strength and to deal with the optimization problem in ML. Thus, the ML model cannot only predict the strength with a high accuracy (R2 > 95 %), but also design compositions efficiently with desired property in multi-component systems. Novel HESAs with targeted strengths and densities were predicted by ML and then validated by a series of experiments. It is found that the experimental results are well consistent with the predicted properties, as evidenced by the fact that the designed Ni-5.82Fe-15.34Co-2.53Al-2.99Ti-2.90Nb-15.97Cr-2.50Mo (wt.%) HESA has a yield strength of 1346 MPa at room temperature and 1061 MPa at 1023 K and a density of 7.98 g/cm3. Moreover, it exhibits superior creep resistance with a rupture lifetime of 149 h under 480 MPa at 1023 K, outperforming most conventional wrought superalloys. Additionally, the coarsening rate of γ' nanoprecipitates in these alloys is extremely slow at 1023 K, showing a prominent microstructural stability. The strengthening and deformation mechanisms were further discussed. This framework provides a new pathway to realize the property-oriented composition design for high-performance complex alloys via ML.

ORGANA plans and executes complex tasks with visual feedback while supporting scheduling and parallel task execution. We demonstrate ORGANA’s capabilities in solubility, pH measurement, recrystallization, and electrochemistry experiments. In electrochemistry, it executes a 19-step plan in parallel to characterize quinone derivatives for flow batteries. Our user study shows ORGANA reduces frustration and physical demand by over 50%, with users saving an average of 80.3% of their time when using it.

**Abstract:**
This research focused on the efficient collection of experimental metal–organic framework (MOF) data from scientific literature to address the challenges of accessing hard-to-find data and improving the quality of information available for machine learning studies in materials science. Utilizing a chain of advanced large language models (LLMs), we developed a systematic approach to extract and organize MOF data into a structured format. Our methodology successfully compiled information from more than 40,000 research articles, creating a comprehensive and ready-to-use data set. Specifically, data regarding MOF synthesis conditions and properties were extracted from both tables and text and then analyzed. Subsequently, we utilized the curated database to analyze the relationships between synthesis conditions, properties, and structure. Through machine learning, we identified the existence of a gap between simulation data and experimental data, and further analysis revealed the factors contributing to this discrepancy. Additionally, we leveraged the extracted synthesis condition data to develop a synthesis condition recommender system. This system suggests optimal synthesis conditions based on the provided precursors, offering a practical tool to refine synthesis strategies. This underscores the importance of experimental datasets in advancing MOF research.

**Pages:** e202417657

**DOI:** 10.1002/ange.202417657

**Abstract:**
The vast size of composition space poses a significant challenge for materials chemistry: exhaustive enumeration of potentially interesting compositions is typically infeasible, hindering assessment of important criteria ranging from novelty and stability to cost and performance. We report a tool, Comgen, for the efficient exploration of composition space, which makes use of logical methods from computer science used for proving theorems. We demonstrate how these techniques, which have not previously been applied to materials discovery, can enable reasoning about scientific domain knowledge provided by human experts. Comgen accepts a variety of user-specified criteria, converts these into an abstract form, and utilises a powerful automated reasoning algorithm to identify compositions that satisfy these user requirements, or prove that the requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied. In contrast to machine learning techniques, explicitly reasoning about domain knowledge, rather than making inferences from data, ensures that Comgen's outputs are fully interpretable and provably correct. Users interact with Comgen through a high-level Python interface. We illustrate use of the tool with several case studies focused on the search for new ionic conductors. Further, we demonstrate the integration of Comgen into an end-to-end automated workflow to propose and evaluate candidate compositions quantitatively, prior to experimental investigation. This highlights the potential of automated formal reasoning in materials chemistry.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 282

**Pages:** 120467

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.actamat.2024.120467

**Abstract:**
Ferroelectric topological phases and phase transitions have been extensively investigated recently due to the rich physical insights and potential applications in next-generation electronic devices. However, precisely predicting the topological phase transitions under different internal and external conditions in polar oxide superlattice systems is challenging due to the complex energy competitions and highly nonlinear kinetics involved. Herein, we adopted a state-of-the-art mathematical concept called “persistent homology” from topological data analysis to extract the essential topological features for the polarization data in various topological structures. By implementing the persistent image as the descriptor, support vector regression (SVR) based convolutional neural network (CNN) models are developed for the automated and high precision classification and regression of topological states based on high-dimensional phase-field simulation data of the PTO/STO superlattice. Using this method, we can automatically construct the strain and electric field phase diagrams in seconds with high throughput phase-field data. We hope to spur further interest in the integration of state-of-the-art mathematical tools, machine learning algorithms, and condensed matter physics for predictions of topological phase transitions.

**Abstract:**
A key challenge in artificial intelligence (AI) is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts is presented: (1) large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi-agent systems with in-situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses human research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the system yields material discoveries, critiques and improves existing hypotheses, retrieves up-to-date data about existing research, and highlights strengths and limitations. This is achieved by harnessing a “swarm of intelligence” similar to biological systems, providing new avenues for discovery. How this model accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles, resulting in a new biocomposite with enhanced mechanical properties and improved sustainability through energy-efficient production is shown.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 637, Issue 8044

**Pages:** 84-90

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-024-08252-9

**Abstract:**
Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather to planning renewable energy use. Traditionally, weather forecasts have been based on numerical weather prediction (NWP)1, which relies on physics-based simulations of the atmosphere. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with less forecast error than single NWP simulations2,3. However, these advances have focused primarily on single, deterministic forecasts that fail to represent uncertainty and estimate risk. Overall, MLWP has remained less accurate and reliable than state-of-the-art NWP ensemble forecasts. Here we introduce GenCast, a probabilistic weather model with greater skill and speed than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world, ENS, the ensemble forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts4. GenCast is an ML weather prediction method, trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-h steps and 0.25° latitude–longitude resolution, for more than 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8 min. It has greater skill than ENS on 97.2% of 1,320 targets we evaluated and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclone tracks and wind power production. This work helps open the next chapter in operational weather forecasting, in which crucial weather-dependent decisions are made more accurately and efficiently.

**Pages:** 2412337

**DOI:** 10.1002/adma.202412337

**Abstract:**
Nanoparticles (NPs) of high entropy materials (HEMs) have attracted significant attention due to their versatility and wide range of applications. HEM NPs can be synthesized by fragmenting bulk HEMs or disintegrating and recrystallizing them. Alternatively, directly producing HEMs in NP form from atomic/ionic/molecular precursors presents a significant challenge. A widely adopted strategy involves thermodynamically driving HEM NP formation by leveraging the entropic contribution but incorporating strategies to limit NP growth at the elevated temperatures used for maximizing entropy. A second approach is to kinetically drive HEM NP formation by promoting rapid reactions of homogeneous reactant mixtures or using highly diluted precursor dissolutions. Additionally, experimental evidence suggests that enthalpy plays a significant role in driving HEM NP formation processes at moderate temperatures, with the high energy cost of generating additional surfaces and interfaces at the nanoscale stabilizing the HEM phase. This review critically assesses the various synthesis strategies developed for HEM NP preparation, highlighting key illustrative examples and offering insights into the underlying formation mechanisms. Such insights are critical for fine-tuning experimental conditions to achieve specific outcomes, ultimately enabling the effective synthesis of optimized generations of these advanced materials for both current and emerging applications across various scientific and technological fields.

**Abstract:**
Large language models (LLMs) are steering the development of generalist materials intelligence (GMI), a unified framework integrating conceptual reasoning, computational modeling, and experimental validation. Central to this framework is the agent-in-the-loop paradigm, where LLM-based agents function as dynamic orchestrators, synthesizing multimodal knowledge, specialized models, and experimental robotics to enable fully autonomous discovery. Drawing from a comprehensive review of LLMs’ transformative impact across representative applications in materials science, including data extraction, property prediction, structure generation, synthesis planning, and self-driven labs, this study underscores how LLMs are revolutionizing traditional tasks, catalyzing the agent-in-the-loop paradigm, and bridging the ontology-concept-computation-experiment continuum. Then the unique challenges of scaling up LLM adoption are discussed, particularly those arising from the misalignment of foundation LLMs with materials-specific knowledge, emphasizing the need to enhance adaptability, efficiency, sustainability, interpretability, and trustworthiness in the pursuit of GMI. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that LLMs are not universally efficient. Their substantial resource demands and inconsistent performance call for careful deployment based on demonstrated task suitability. To address these realities, actionable strategies and a progressive roadmap for equitably and democratically implementing materials-aware LLMs in real-world practices are proposed.

**DOI:** 10.1002/adma.202413430

**Abstract:**
Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a pioneering tool in advancing the research application of high-performance solid-state hydrogen storage materials (HSMs). This review summarizes the state-of-the-art research of ML in resolving crucial issues such as low hydrogen storage capacity and unfavorable de-/hydrogenation cycling conditions.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 5, Issue 1

**DOI:** 10.1038/s43246-024-00708-9

**Abstract:**
Automated data extraction from materials science literature at scale using artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques is critical to advance materials discovery. However, this process for large spans of text continues to be a challenge due to the specific nature and styles of scientific manuscripts. In this study, we present a framework to automatically extract polymer-property data from full-text journal articles using commercially available (GPT-3.5) and open-source (LlaMa 2) large language models (LLM), in tandem with the named entity recognition (NER)-based MaterialsBERT model. Leveraging a corpus of ~ 2.4 million full text articles, our method successfully identified and processed around 681,000 polymer-related articles, resulting in the extraction of over one million records corresponding to 24 properties of over 106,000 unique polymers. We additionally conducted an extensive evaluation of the performance and associated costs of the LLMs used for data extraction, compared to the NER model. We suggest methodologies to optimize costs, provide insights on effective inference via in-context few-shots learning, and illuminate gaps and opportunities for future studies utilizing LLMs for natural language processing in polymer science. The extracted polymer-property data has been made publicly available for the wider scientific community via the Polymer Scholar website.

**Pages:** 846-865

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41578-024-00720-y

**Abstract:**
Entropy-related phase stabilization can allow compositionally complex solid solutions of multiple principal elements. The massive mixing approach was originally introduced for metals and has recently been extended to ionic, semiconductor, polymer and low-dimensional materials. Multielement mixing can leverage new types of random, weakly ordered clustering and precipitation states in bulk materials as well as at interfaces and dislocations. The many possible atomic configurations offer opportunities to discover and exploit new functionalities, as well as to create new local symmetry features, ordering phenomena and interstitial configurations. This opens up a huge chemical and structural space in which uncharted phase states, defect chemistries, mechanisms and properties, some previously thought to be mutually exclusive, can be reconciled in one material. Earlier research concentrated on mechanical properties such as strength, toughness, fatigue and ductility. This Review shifts the focus towards multifunctional property profiles, including electronic, electrochemical, mechanical, magnetic, catalytic, hydrogen-related, Invar and caloric characteristics. Disruptive design opportunities lie in combining several of these features, rendering high-entropy materials multifunctional without sacrificing their unique mechanical properties.

**Pages:** 10160

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-54457-x

**Abstract:**
The rapid emergence of large language model (LLM) technology presents promising opportunities to facilitate the development of synthetic reactions. In this work, we leveraged the power of GPT-4 to build an LLM-based reaction development framework (LLM-RDF) to handle fundamental tasks involved throughout the chemical synthesis development. LLM-RDF comprises six specialized LLM-based agents, including Literature Scouter, Experiment Designer, Hardware Executor, Spectrum Analyzer, Separation Instructor, and Result Interpreter, which are pre-prompted to accomplish the designated tasks. A web application with LLM-RDF as the backend was built to allow chemist users to interact with automated experimental platforms and analyze results via natural language, thus, eliminating the need for coding skills and ensuring accessibility for all chemists. We demonstrated the capabilities of LLM-RDF in guiding the end-to-end synthesis development process for the copper/TEMPO catalyzed aerobic alcohol oxidation to aldehyde reaction, including literature search and information extraction, substrate scope and condition screening, reaction kinetics study, reaction condition optimization, reaction scale-up and product purification. Furthermore, LLM-RDF’s broader applicability and versability was validated on various synthesis tasks of three distinct reactions (SNAr reaction, photoredox C-C cross-coupling reaction, and heterogeneous photoelectrochemical reaction).

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 146, Issue 44

**Pages:** 30340-30348

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.4c10244

**Abstract:**
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is a cornerstone technique in materials characterization. However, complete structure determination from PXRD patterns alone remains time-consuming and is often intractable, especially for novel materials. Current machine learning (ML) approaches to PXRD analysis predict only a subset of the total information that comprises a crystal structure. We developed a pioneering generative ML model designed to solve crystal structures from real-world experimental PXRD data. In addition to strong performance on simulated diffraction patterns, we demonstrate full structure solutions over a large set of experimental diffraction patterns. Benchmarking our model, we predicted the structure for 134 experimental patterns from the RRUFF database and thousands of simulated patterns from the Materials Project on which our model achieves state-of-the-art 42 and 67% match rate, respectively. Further, we applied our model to determine the unreported structures of materials such as NaCu2P2, Ca2MnTeO6, ZrGe6Ni6, LuOF, and HoNdV2O8 from the Powder Diffraction File database. We extended this methodology to new materials created in our lab at high pressure with previously unsolved structures and found the new binary compounds Rh3Bi, RuBi2, and KBi3. We expect that our model will open avenues toward materials discovery under conditions which preclude single crystal growth and toward automated materials discovery pipelines, opening the door to new domains of chemistry.

### 97. A Machine Learning Study on High Thermal Conductivity Assisted to Discover Chalcogenides with Balanced Infrared Nonlinear Optical Performance

**Authors:** Qingchen Wu, Lei Kang, Zheshuai Lin

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 36, Issue 6

**Pages:** 2309675

**DOI:** 10.1002/adma.202309675

**Abstract:**
Exploration of novel nonlinear optical (NLO) chalcogenides with high laser-induced damage thresholds (LIDT) is critical for mid-infrared (mid-IR) solid-state laser applications. High lattice thermal conductivity (κL) is crucial to increasing LIDT yet often neglected in the search for NLO crystals due to lack of accurate κL data. A machine learning (ML) approach to predict κL for over 6000 chalcogenides is hereby proposed. Combining ML-generated κL data and first-principles calculation, a high-throughput screening route is initiated, and ten new potential mid-IR NLO chalcogenides with optimal bandgap, NLO coefficients, and thermal conductivity are discovered, in which Li2SiS3 and AlZnGaS4 are highlighted. Big-data analysis on structural chemistry proves that the chalcogenides having dense and simple lattice structures with low anisotropy, light atoms, and strong covalent bonds are likely to possess higher κL. The four-coordinated motifs in which central cations show the bond valence sum of +2 to +3 and are from IIIA, IVA, VA, and IIB groups, such as those in diamond-like defect-chalcopyrite chalcogenides, are preferred to fulfill the desired structural chemistry conditions for balanced NLO and thermal properties. This work provides not only an efficient strategy but also interpretable research directions in the search for NLO crystals with high thermal conductivity.

**Publication Date:** November 2024

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 635, Issue 8040

**Pages:** 890-897

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-024-08173-7

**Abstract:**
Autonomous laboratories can accelerate discoveries in chemical synthesis, but this requires automated measurements coupled with reliable decision-making1,2. Most autonomous laboratories involve bespoke automated equipment3–6, and reaction outcomes are often assessed using a single, hard-wired characterization technique7. Any decision-making algorithms8 must then operate using this narrow range of characterization data9,10. By contrast, manual experiments tend to draw on a wider range of instruments to characterize reaction products, and decisions are rarely taken based on one measurement alone. Here we show that a synthesis laboratory can be integrated into an autonomous laboratory by using mobile robots11–13 that operate equipment and make decisions in a human-like way. Our modular workflow combines mobile robots, an automated synthesis platform, a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometer and a benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. This allows robots to share existing laboratory equipment with human researchers without monopolizing it or requiring extensive redesign. A heuristic decision-maker processes the orthogonal measurement data, selecting successful reactions to take forward and automatically checking the reproducibility of any screening hits. We exemplify this approach in the three areas of structural diversification chemistry, supramolecular host–guest chemistry and photochemical synthesis. This strategy is particularly suited to exploratory chemistry that can yield multiple potential products, as for supramolecular assemblies, where we also extend the method to an autonomous function assay by evaluating host–guest binding properties.

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.4c10294

**Abstract:**
Exploratory synthesis of solids is essential for the advancement of materials science but is also highly time- and resource-intensive. Here, we demonstrate an efficient strategy to explore solid-state synthesis of quaternary cesium chlorides in the search space of CsnAIBCl6 (n = 2 or 3, A = Li, Na or K, and B = d or p-block metal), where the target compositions are selected from a pool of candidates based on computationally predicted stabilities and availability of viable precursor powders. Synthesizability of the targets is assessed by observing the evolution of starting phases upon heating under in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Laboratory synthesis is attempted for promising targets, and resulting materials are characterized by powder X-ray and neutron diffraction and subsequent Rietveld refinement. We focus on how computational predictions can be bridged to experimental characterizations in exploratory synthesis and report on successful and failed synthesis attempts for compounds of type Cs2AIBIIICl6, revealing underexplored variants including new polymorphs of Cs2LiCrCl6 and Cs2LiRuCl6, and a new compound Cs2LiIrCl6.

**Abstract:**
Laboratories in chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science are at the leading edge of technology, discovering molecules and materials to unlock capabilities in energy, catalysis, biotechnology, sustainability, electronics, and more. Yet, most modern laboratories resemble factories from generations past, with a large reliance on humans manually performing synthesis and characterization tasks. Robotics and automation can enable scientific experiments to be conducted faster, more safely, more accurately, and with greater reproducibility, allowing scientists to tackle large societal problems in domains such as health and energy on a shorter timescale. We define five levels of laboratory automation, from laboratory assistance to full automation. We also introduce robotics research challenges that arise when increasing levels of automation and when increasing the generality of tasks within the laboratory. Robots are poised to transform science labs into automated factories of discovery that accelerate scientific progress.

**Abstract:**
Combining materials science, artificial intelligence (AI), physical chemistry, and other disciplines, materials informatics is continuously accelerating the vigorous development of new materials. The emergence of “GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) AI” shows that the scientific research field has entered the era of intelligent civilization with “data” as the basic factor and “algorithm + computing power” as the core productivity. The continuous innovation of AI will impact the cognitive laws and scientific methods, and reconstruct the knowledge and wisdom system. This leads to think more about materials informatics. Here, a comprehensive discussion of AI models and materials infrastructures is provided, and the advances in the discovery and design of new materials are reviewed. With the rise of new research paradigms triggered by “AI for Science”, the vane of materials informatics: “MatGPT”, is proposed and the technical path planning from the aspects of data, descriptors, generative models, pretraining models, directed design models, collaborative training, experimental robots, as well as the efforts and preparations needed to develop a new generation of materials informatics, is carried out. Finally, the challenges and constraints faced by materials informatics are discussed, in order to achieve a more digital, intelligent, and automated construction of materials informatics with the joint efforts of more interdisciplinary scientists.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 8148

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-52378-3

**Abstract:**
In computational molecular and materials science, determining equilibrium structures is the crucial first step for accurate subsequent property calculations. However, the recent discovery of millions of new crystals and super large twisted structures has challenged traditional computational methods, both ab initio and machine-learning-based, due to their computationally intensive iterative processes. To address these scalability issues, here we introduce DeepRelax, a deep generative model capable of performing geometric crystal structure relaxation rapidly and without iterations. DeepRelax learns the equilibrium structural distribution, enabling it to predict relaxed structures directly from their unrelaxed ones. The ability to perform structural relaxation at the millisecond level per structure, combined with the scalability of parallel processing, makes DeepRelax particularly useful for large-scale virtual screening. We demonstrate DeepRelax’s reliability and robustness by applying it to five diverse databases, including oxides, Materials Project, two-dimensional materials, van der Waals crystals, and crystals with point defects. DeepRelax consistently shows high accuracy and efficiency, validated by density functional theory calculations. Finally, we enhance its trustworthiness by integrating uncertainty quantification. This work significantly accelerates computational workflows, offering a robust and trustworthy machine-learning method for material discovery and advancing the application of AI for science.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 7407

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-51844-2

**Abstract:**
Prediction methods inputting embeddings from protein language models have reached or even surpassed state-of-the-art performance on many protein prediction tasks. In natural language processing fine-tuning large language models has become the de facto standard. In contrast, most protein language model-based protein predictions do not back-propagate to the language model. Here, we compare the fine-tuning of three state-of-the-art models (ESM2, ProtT5, Ankh) on eight different tasks. Two results stand out. Firstly, task-specific supervised fine-tuning almost always improves downstream predictions. Secondly, parameter-efficient fine-tuning can reach similar improvements consuming substantially fewer resources at up to 4.5-fold acceleration of training over fine-tuning full models. Our results suggest to always try fine-tuning, in particular for problems with small datasets, such as for fitness landscape predictions of a single protein. For ease of adaptability, we provide easy-to-use notebooks to fine-tune all models used during this work for per-protein (pooling) and per-residue prediction tasks.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 6977

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-51379-6

**Abstract:**
Materials demonstrating positive thermal expansion (PTE) or negative thermal expansion (NTE) are quite common, whereas those exhibiting zero thermal expansion (ZTE) are notably scarce. In this work, we identify the mechanical descriptors, namely in-plane tensile stiffness and out-of-plane bending stiffness, that can effectively classify PTE and NTE 2D crystals. By utilizing high throughput calculations and the state-of-the-art symbolic regression method, these descriptors aid in the discovery of ZTE or 2D Invar monolayers with the linear thermal expansion coefficient (LTEC) within ±2 × 10−6 K−1 in the middle range of temperatures. Additionally, the descriptors assist the discovery of large PTE and NTE 2D monolayers with the LTEC larger than ±15 × 10−6 K−1, which are so-called 2D anti-Invar monolayers. Advancing our understanding of materials with exceptionally low or high thermal expansion is of substantial scientific and technological interest, particularly in the development of next-generation electronics at the nanometer or even Ångstrom scale.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-50884-y

**Abstract:**
Accelerating perovskite solid solution discovery and sustainable synthesis is crucial for addressing challenges in wireless communication and biosensors. However, the vast array of chemical compositions and their dependence on factors such as crystal structure, and sintering temperature require time-consuming manual processes. To overcome these constraints, we introduce an automated materials discovery approach encompassing machine learning (ML) assisted material screening, robotic synthesis, and high-throughput characterization. Our proposed platform for rapid sintering and dielectric analysis streamlines the characterization of perovskites and the discovery of disordered materials. The setup has been successfully validated, demonstrating processing materials within minutes, in stark contrast to conventional procedures that can take hours or days. Following setup validation with established samples, we showcase synthesizing single-phase solid solutions within the barium family, such as (BaxSr1-x)CeO3, identified through ML-guided chemistry.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 274

**Pages:** 120017

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.actamat.2024.120017

**Abstract:**
The design of alloys has typically involved adaptive experimental synthesis and characterization guided by machine learning models fitted to available data. A bottleneck for sequential design, be it for self-driven or manual synthesis, by Bayesian Global Optimization (BGO) for example, is that the search space becomes intractable as the number of alloy elements and its compositions exceed a threshold. Here we investigate how reinforcement learning (RL) performs in the compositional design of alloys within a closed loop with manual synthesis and characterization. We demonstrate this strategy by designing a phase change multicomponent alloy (Ti27.2Ni47Hf13.8Zr12) with the highest transformation enthalpy (ΔH) -37.1 J/g (-39.0 J/g with further calibration) within the TiNi-based family of alloys from a space of over 2 × 108 candidates, although the initial training is only on a compact dataset of 112 alloys. We show how the training efficiency is increased by employing acquisition functions containing uncertainties, such as expected improvement (EI), as the reward itself. Existing alloy data is often limited, however, if the agent is pretrained on experimental results prior to the training process, it can access regions of higher reward values more frequently. In addition, the experimental feedback enables the agent to gradually explore new regions with higher rewards, compositionally different from the initial dataset. Our approach directly applies to processing conditions where the actions would be performed in a given order. We also compare RL performance to BGO and the genetic algorithm on several test functions to gain insight on their relative strengths in materials design.

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.4c03849

**Abstract:**
High-throughput computational materials discovery has promised significant acceleration of the design and discovery of new materials for many years. Despite a surge in interest and activity, the constraints imposed by large-scale computational resources present a significant bottleneck. Furthermore, examples of large-scale computational discovery carried through experimental validation remain scarce, especially for materials with product applicability. Here we demonstrate how this vision became reality by first combining state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) models and traditional physics-based models on cloud high-performance computing (HPC) resources to quickly navigate through more than 32 million candidates and predict around half a million potentially stable materials. By focusing on solid-state electrolytes for battery applications, our discovery pipeline further identified 18 promising candidates with new compositions and rediscovered a decade's worth of collective knowledge in the field as a byproduct. By employing around one thousand virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud, this process took less than 80 hours. We then synthesized and experimentally characterized the structures and conductivities of our top candidates, the Na$_x$Li$_{3-x}$YCl$_6$ ($0 < x < 3$) series, demonstrating the potential of these compounds to serve as solid electrolytes. Additional candidate materials that are currently under experimental investigation could offer more examples of the computational discovery of new phases of Li- and Na-conducting solid electrolytes. We believe that this unprecedented approach of synergistically integrating AI models and cloud HPC not only accelerates materials discovery but also showcases the potency of AI-guided experimentation in unlocking transformative scientific breakthroughs with real-world applications.

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.4c05840

**Abstract:**
We evaluate the effectiveness of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for predicting the synthesizability of inorganic compounds and the selection of precursors needed to perform inorganic synthesis. The predictions of fine-tuned LLMs are comparable to─and sometimes better than─recent bespoke machine learning models for these tasks but require only minimal user expertise, cost, and time to develop.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 5391

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-49686-z

**Abstract:**
Data scarcity is one of the critical bottlenecks to utilizing machine learning in material discovery. Transfer learning can use existing big data to assist property prediction on small data sets, but the premise is that there must be a strong correlation between large and small data sets. To extend its applicability in scenarios with different properties and materials, here we develop a hybrid framework combining adversarial transfer learning and expert knowledge, which enables the direct prediction of carrier mobility of two-dimensional (2D) materials using the knowledge learned from bulk effective mass. Specifically, adversarial training ensures that only common knowledge between bulk and 2D materials is extracted while expert knowledge is incorporated to further improve the prediction accuracy and generalizability. Successfully, 2D carrier mobilities are predicted with the accuracy over 90% from only crystal structure, and 21 2D semiconductors with carrier mobilities far exceeding silicon and suitable bandgap are successfully screened out. This work enables transfer learning in simultaneous cross-property and cross-material scenarios, providing an effective tool to predict intricate material properties with limited data.

**Publication Date:** June 10, 2024

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 4940

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-49170-8

**Abstract:**
Dielectric capacitors offer great potential for advanced electronics due to their high power densities, but their energy density still needs to be further improved. High-entropy strategy has emerged as an effective method for improving energy storage performance, however, discovering new high-entropy systems within a high-dimensional composition space is a daunting challenge for traditional trial-and-error experiments. Here, based on phase-field simulations and limited experimental data, we propose a generative learning approach to accelerate the discovery of high-entropy dielectrics in a practically infinite exploration space of over 1011 combinations. By encoding-decoding latent space regularities to facilitate data sampling and forward inference, we employ inverse design to screen out the most promising combinations via a ranking strategy. Through only 5 sets of targeted experiments, we successfully obtain a Bi(Mg0.5Ti0.5)O3-based high-entropy dielectric film with a significantly improved energy density of 156 J cm−3 at an electric field of 5104 kV cm−1, surpassing the pristine film by more than eight-fold. This work introduces an effective and innovative avenue for designing high-entropy dielectrics with drastically reduced experimental cycles, which could be also extended to expedite the design of other multicomponent material systems with desired properties.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-49172-6

**Abstract:**
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have versatile applications in luminescence, whereas identifying optimal synthesis conditions has been challenging due to numerous synthesis parameters and multiple desired outcomes, creating an enormous search space. In this study, we present a novel multi-objective optimization strategy utilizing a machine learning (ML) algorithm to intelligently guide the hydrothermal synthesis of CQDs. Our closed-loop approach learns from limited and sparse data, greatly reducing the research cycle and surpassing traditional trial-and-error methods. Moreover, it also reveals the intricate links between synthesis parameters and target properties and unifies the objective function to optimize multiple desired properties like full-color photoluminescence (PL) wavelength and high PL quantum yields (PLQY). With only 63 experiments, we achieve the synthesis of full-color fluorescent CQDs with high PLQY exceeding 60% across all colors. Our study represents a significant advancement in ML-guided CQDs synthesis, setting the stage for developing new materials with multiple desired properties.

**DOI:** 10.1002/adma.202304269

**Abstract:**
Copper antimony sulfides are regarded as promising catalysts for photo-electrochemical water splitting because of their earth abundance and broad light absorption. The unique photoactivity of copper antimony sulfides is dependent on their various crystalline structures and atomic compositions. Here, a closed-loop workflow is built, which explores Cu–Sb–S compositional space to optimize its photo-electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water, by integrating a high-throughput robotic platform, characterization techniques, and machine learning (ML) optimization workflow. The multi-objective optimization model discovers optimum experimental conditions after only nine cycles of integrated experiments–machine learning loop. Photocurrent testing at 0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) confirms the expected correlation between the materials’ properties and photocurrent. An optimum photocurrent of −186 µA cm−2 is observed on Cu–Sb–S in the ratio of 9:45:46 in the form of single-layer coating on F-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass with a corresponding bandgap of 1.85 eV and 63.2% Cu1+/Cu species content. The targeted intelligent search reveals a nonobvious CuSbS composition that exhibits 2.3 times greater activity than baseline results from random sampling.

**Pages:** 493-500

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-024-07487-w

**Abstract:**
The introduction of AlphaFold 21 has spurred a revolution in modelling the structure of proteins and their interactions, enabling a huge range of applications in protein modelling and design2–6. Here we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein–ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein–nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody–antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37,8. Together, these results show that high-accuracy modelling across biomolecular space is possible within a single unified deep-learning framework.

The HE effect, coupled with hysteresis diffusion, imparts these materials with desirable thermal and chemical stability. These attributes position HE materials as a revolutionary alternative to traditional photothermal materials, signifying a transformative shift in photothermal technology. This review delivers a comprehensive summary of the current state of knowledge regarding HE photothermal materials, emphasizing the intricate relationship between their compositions, structures, light-absorbing mechanisms, and optical properties. Furthermore, the review outlines the notable advances in HE photothermal materials, emphasizing their contributions to areas, such as solar water evaporation, personal thermal management, solar thermoelectric generation, catalysis, and biomedical applications. The review culminates in presenting a roadmap that outlines prospective directions for future research in this burgeoning field, and also outlines fruitful ways to develop advanced HE photothermal materials and to expand their promising applications.

### 74. Diffusion-based deep learning method for augmenting ultrastructural imaging and volume electron microscopy

**Authors:** Chixiang Lu, Kai Chen, Heng Qiu, Xiaojun Chen, Gu Chen, Xiaojuan Qi, Haibo Jiang

**Venue:** Nature Communications

**Publication Date:** June 01, 2024

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 4677

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-49125-z

**Abstract:**
Electron microscopy (EM) revolutionized the way to visualize cellular ultrastructure. Volume EM (vEM) has further broadened its three-dimensional nanoscale imaging capacity. However, intrinsic trade-offs between imaging speed and quality of EM restrict the attainable imaging area and volume. Isotropic imaging with vEM for large biological volumes remains unachievable. Here, we developed EMDiffuse, a suite of algorithms designed to enhance EM and vEM capabilities, leveraging the cutting-edge image generation diffusion model. EMDiffuse generates realistic predictions with high resolution ultrastructural details and exhibits robust transferability by taking only one pair of images of 3 megapixels to fine-tune in denoising and super-resolution tasks. EMDiffuse also demonstrated proficiency in the isotropic vEM reconstruction task, generating isotropic volume even in the absence of isotropic training data. We demonstrated the robustness of EMDiffuse by generating isotropic volumes from seven public datasets obtained from different vEM techniques and instruments. The generated isotropic volume enables accurate three-dimensional nanoscale ultrastructure analysis. EMDiffuse also features self-assessment functionalities on predictions’ reliability. We envision EMDiffuse to pave the way for investigations of the intricate subcellular nanoscale ultrastructure within large volumes of biological systems.

**DOI:** 10.1002/adma.202405163

**Abstract:**
Large language models (LLMs) have attracted widespread attention recently, however, their application in specialized scientific fields still requires deep adaptation. Here, an artificial intelligence (AI) agent for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) is designed by integrating the generative pre-trained transformer 4 (GPT-4) model with well-trained machine learning (ML) algorithms. It can efficiently extract the experimental parameters of OFETs from scientific literature and reshape them into a structured database, achieving precision and recall rates both exceeding 92%. Combined with well-trained ML models, this AI agent can further provide targeted guidance and suggestions for device design. With prompt engineering and human-in-loop strategies, the agent extracts sufficient information of 709 OFETs from 277 research articles across different publishers and gathers them into a standardized database containing more than 10 000 device parameters. Using this database, a ML model based on Extreme Gradient Boosting is trained for device performance judgment. Combined with the interpretation of the high-precision model, the agent has provided a feasible optimization scheme that has tripled the charge transport properties of 2,6-diphenyldithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene OFETs. This work is an effective practice of LLMs in the field of organic optoelectronic devices and expands the research paradigm of organic optoelectronic materials and devices.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s44160-024-00502-y

**Abstract:**
Efficient synthesis recipes are needed to streamline the manufacturing of complex materials and to accelerate the realization of theoretically predicted materials. Often, the solid-state synthesis of multicomponent oxides is impeded by undesired by-product phases, which can kinetically trap reactions in an incomplete non-equilibrium state. Here we report a thermodynamic strategy to navigate high-dimensional phase diagrams in search of precursors that circumvent low-energy, competing by-products, while maximizing the reaction energy to drive fast phase transformation kinetics. Using a robotic inorganic materials synthesis laboratory, we perform a large-scale experimental validation of our precursor selection principles. For a set of 35 target quaternary oxides, with chemistries representative of intercalation battery cathodes and solid-state electrolytes, our robot performs 224 reactions spanning 27 elements with 28 unique precursors, operated by 1 human experimentalist. Our predicted precursors frequently yield target materials with higher phase purity than traditional precursors. Robotic laboratories offer an exciting platform for data-driven experimental synthesis science, from which we can develop fundamental insights to guide both human and robotic chemists.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 146, Issue 12

**Pages:** 8098-8109

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.3c11852

**Abstract:**
Determining the structures of previously unseen compounds from experimental characterizations is a crucial part of materials science. It requires a step of searching for the structure type that conforms to the lattice of the unknown compound, which enables the pattern matching process for characterization data, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. However, this procedure typically places a high demand on domain expertise, thus creating an obstacle for computer-driven automation. Here, we address this challenge by leveraging a deep-learning model composed of a union of convolutional residual neural networks. The accuracy of the model is demonstrated on a dataset of over 60,000 different compounds for 100 structure types, and additional categories can be integrated without the need to retrain the existing networks. We also unravel the operation of the deep-learning black box and highlight the way in which the resemblance between the unknown compound and a structure type is quantified based on both local and global characteristics in XRD patterns. This computational tool opens new avenues for automating structure analysis on materials unearthed in high-throughput experimentation.

### 67. Extracting accurate materials data from research papers with conversational language models and prompt engineering

**Authors:** Maciej P. Polak, Dane Morgan

**Venue:** Nature Communications

**Publication Date:** February 21, 2024

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 1569

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-45914-8

**Abstract:**
There has been a growing effort to replace manual extraction of data from research papers with automated data extraction based on natural language processing, language models, and recently, large language models (LLMs). Although these methods enable efficient extraction of data from large sets of research papers, they require a significant amount of up-front effort, expertise, and coding. In this work, we propose the ChatExtract method that can fully automate very accurate data extraction with minimal initial effort and background, using an advanced conversational LLM. ChatExtract consists of a set of engineered prompts applied to a conversational LLM that both identify sentences with data, extract that data, and assure the data’s correctness through a series of follow-up questions. These follow-up questions largely overcome known issues with LLMs providing factually inaccurate responses. ChatExtract can be applied with any conversational LLMs and yields very high quality data extraction. In tests on materials data, we find precision and recall both close to 90% from the best conversational LLMs, like GPT-4. We demonstrate that the exceptional performance is enabled by the information retention in a conversational model combined with purposeful redundancy and introducing uncertainty through follow-up prompts. These results suggest that approaches similar to ChatExtract, due to their simplicity, transferability, and accuracy are likely to become powerful tools for data extraction in the near future. Finally, databases for critical cooling rates of metallic glasses and yield strengths of high entropy alloys are developed using ChatExtract.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-45563-x

**Abstract:**
Extracting structured knowledge from scientific text remains a challenging task for machine learning models. Here, we present a simple approach to joint named entity recognition and relation extraction and demonstrate how pretrained large language models (GPT-3, Llama-2) can be fine-tuned to extract useful records of complex scientific knowledge. We test three representative tasks in materials chemistry: linking dopants and host materials, cataloging metal-organic frameworks, and general composition/phase/morphology/application information extraction. Records are extracted from single sentences or entire paragraphs, and the output can be returned as simple English sentences or a more structured format such as a list of JSON objects. This approach represents a simple, accessible, and highly flexible route to obtaining large databases of structured specialized scientific knowledge extracted from research papers.

The optimization, intensification, and scale-up of photochemical processes constitute a particular challenge in a manufacturing environment geared primarily toward thermal chemistry.

Our open-source platform combines a liquid handler, syringe pumps, a tunable continuous-flow photoreactor, inexpensive Internet of Things devices, and an in-line benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer to enable automated, data-rich optimization with a closed-loop Bayesian optimization strategy. A user-friendly graphical interface allows chemists without programming or machine learning expertise to easily monitor, analyze, and improve photocatalytic reactions with respect to both continuous and discrete variables. The system's effectiveness was demonstrated by increasing overall reaction yields and improving space-time yields compared with those of previously reported processes.

**Abstract:**
Machine learning holds significant research potential in the field of nanotechnology, enabling nanomaterial structure and property predictions, facilitating materials design and discovery, and reducing the need for time-consuming and labor-intensive experiments and simulations. In contrast to their achiral counterparts, the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials is still in its infancy, with a limited number of publications to date. This is despite the great potential of machine learning to advance the development of new sustainable chiral materials with high values of optical activity, circularly polarized luminescence, and enantioselectivity, as well as for the analysis of structural chirality by electron microscopy. In this review, an analysis of machine learning methods used for studying achiral nanomaterials is provided, subsequently offering guidance on adapting and extending this work to chiral nanomaterials. An overview of chiral nanomaterials within the framework of synthesis–structure–property–application relationships is presented and insights on how to leverage machine learning for the study of these highly complex relationships are provided. Some key recent publications are reviewed and discussed on the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials. Finally, the review captures the key achievements, ongoing challenges, and the prospective outlook for this very important research field.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 138

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-023-44236-5

**Abstract:**
The past decade has witnessed the significant efforts in novel material discovery in the use of data-driven techniques, in particular, machine learning (ML). However, since it needs to consider the precursors, experimental conditions, and availability of reactants, material synthesis is generally much more complex than property and structure prediction, and very few computational predictions are experimentally realized. To solve these challenges, a universal framework that integrates high-throughput experiments, a priori knowledge of chemistry, and ML techniques such as subgroup discovery and support vector machine is proposed to guide the experimental synthesis of materials, which is capable of disclosing structure-property relationship hidden in high-throughput experiments and rapidly screening out materials with high synthesis feasibility from vast chemical space. Through application of our approach to challenging and consequential synthesis problem of 2D silver/bismuth organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites, we have increased the success rate of the synthesis feasibility by a factor of four relative to traditional approaches. This study provides a practical route for solving multidimensional chemical acceleration problems with small dataset from typical laboratory with limited experimental resources available.

**Authors:** Jacob T. Rapp, Bennett J. Bremer, Philip A. Romero

**Venue:** Nature Chemical Engineering

**Publication Date:** January 2024

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 1, Issue 1

**Pages:** 97-107

**DOI:** 10.1038/s44286-023-00002-4

**Abstract:**
Protein engineering has nearly limitless applications across chemistry, energy and medicine, but creating new proteins with improved or novel functions remains slow, labor-intensive and inefficient. Here we present the Self-driving Autonomous Machines for Protein Landscape Exploration (SAMPLE) platform for fully autonomous protein engineering. SAMPLE is driven by an intelligent agent that learns protein sequence–function relationships, designs new proteins and sends designs to a fully automated robotic system that experimentally tests the designed proteins and provides feedback to improve the agent’s understanding of the system. We deploy four SAMPLE agents with the goal of engineering glycoside hydrolase enzymes with enhanced thermal tolerance. Despite showing individual differences in their search behavior, all four agents quickly converge on thermostable enzymes. Self-driving laboratories automate and accelerate the scientific discovery process and hold great potential for the fields of protein engineering and synthetic biology.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 382, Issue 6677

**Pages:** 1416-1421

**DOI:** 10.1126/science.adi2336

**Abstract:**
Global medium-range weather forecasting is critical to decision-making across many social and economic domains. Traditional numerical weather prediction uses increased compute resources to improve forecast accuracy but does not directly use historical weather data to improve the underlying model. Here, we introduce GraphCast, a machine learning–based method trained directly from reanalysis data. It predicts hundreds of weather variables for the next 10 days at 0.25° resolution globally in under 1 minute. GraphCast significantly outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems on 90% of 1380 verification targets, and its forecasts support better severe event prediction, including tropical cyclone tracking, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. GraphCast is a key advance in accurate and efficient weather forecasting and helps realize the promise of machine learning for modeling complex dynamical systems.

**Authors:** Iman Peivaste, Ericmoore Jossou, Ahmed A. Tiamiyu

**Venue:** Scientific Reports

**Publication Date:** December 18, 2023

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 13, Issue 1

**Pages:** 22556

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41598-023-50044-0

**Abstract:**
High-entropy alloys (HEAs) represent a promising class of materials with exceptional structural and functional properties. However, their design and optimization pose challenges due to the large composition-phase space coupled with the complex and diverse nature of the phase formation dynamics. In this study, a data-driven approach that utilizes machine learning (ML) techniques to predict HEA phases and their composition-dependent phases is proposed. By employing a comprehensive dataset comprising 5692 experimental records encompassing 50 elements and 11 phase categories, we compare the performance of various ML models. Our analysis identifies the most influential features for accurate phase prediction. Furthermore, the class imbalance is addressed by employing data augmentation methods, raising the number of records to 1500 in each category, and ensuring a balanced representation of phase categories. The results show that XGBoost and Random Forest consistently outperform the other models, achieving 86% accuracy in predicting all phases. Additionally, this work provides an extensive analysis of HEA phase formers, showing the contributions of elements and features to the presence of specific phases. We also examine the impact of including different phases on ML model accuracy and feature significance. Notably, the findings underscore the need for ML model selection based on specific applications and desired predictions, as feature importance varies across models and phases. This study significantly advances the understanding of HEA phase formation, enabling targeted alloy design and fostering progress in the field of materials science.

**Venue:** Nature

**Publication Date:** December 2023

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 624, Issue 7990

**Pages:** 80-85

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-023-06735-9

**Abstract:**
Novel functional materials enable fundamental breakthroughs across technological applications from clean energy to information processing1–11. From microchips to batteries and photovoltaics, discovery of inorganic crystals has been bottlenecked by expensive trial-and-error approaches. Concurrently, deep-learning models for language, vision and biology have showcased emergent predictive capabilities with increasing data and computation12–14. Here we show that graph networks trained at scale can reach unprecedented levels of generalization, improving the efficiency of materials discovery by an order of magnitude. Building on 48,000 stable crystals identified in continuing studies15–17, improved efficiency enables the discovery of 2.2 million structures below the current convex hull, many of which escaped previous human chemical intuition. Our work represents an order-of-magnitude expansion in stable materials known to humanity. Stable discoveries that are on the final convex hull will be made available to screen for technological applications, as we demonstrate for layered materials and solid-electrolyte candidates. Of the stable structures, 736 have already been independently experimentally realized. The scale and diversity of hundreds of millions of first-principles calculations also unlock modelling capabilities for downstream applications, leading in particular to highly accurate and robust learned interatomic potentials that can be used in condensed-phase molecular-dynamics simulations and high-fidelity zero-shot prediction of ionic conductivity.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 624, Issue 7990

**Pages:** 86-91

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-023-06734-w

**Abstract:**
To close the gap between the rates of computational screening and experimental realization of novel materials1,2, we introduce the A-Lab, an autonomous laboratory for the solid-state synthesis of inorganic powders. This platform uses computations, historical data from the literature, machine learning (ML) and active learning to plan and interpret the outcomes of experiments performed using robotics. Over 17 days of continuous operation, the A-Lab realized 41 novel compounds from a set of 58 targets including a variety of oxides and phosphates that were identified using large-scale ab initio phase-stability data from the Materials Project and Google DeepMind. Synthesis recipes were proposed by natural-language models trained on the literature and optimized using an active-learning approach grounded in thermodynamics. Analysis of the failed syntheses provides direct and actionable suggestions to improve current techniques for materials screening and synthesis design. The high success rate demonstrates the effectiveness of artificial-intelligence-driven platforms for autonomous materials discovery and motivates further integration of computations, historical knowledge and robotics.

**Publication Date:** October 19, 2023

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 14, Issue 1

**Pages:** 6630

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-023-42415-y

**Abstract:**
Architected materials that consist of multiple subelements arranged in particular orders can demonstrate a much broader range of properties than their constituent materials. However, the rational design of these materials generally relies on experts’ prior knowledge and requires painstaking effort. Here, we present a data-efficient method for the high-dimensional multi-property optimization of 3D-printed architected materials utilizing a machine learning (ML) cycle consisting of the finite element method (FEM) and 3D neural networks. Specifically, we apply our method to orthopedic implant design. Compared to uniform designs, our experience-free method designs microscale heterogeneous architectures with a biocompatible elastic modulus and higher strength. Furthermore, inspired by the knowledge learned from the neural networks, we develop machine-human synergy, adapting the ML-designed architecture to fix a macroscale, irregularly shaped animal bone defect. Such adaptation exhibits 20% higher experimental load-bearing capacity than the uniform design. Thus, our method provides a data-efficient paradigm for the fast and intelligent design of architected materials with tailored mechanical, physical, and chemical properties.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 14, Issue 1

**Pages:** 5861

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-023-41341-3

**Abstract:**
Designing novel catalysts is key to solving many energy and environmental challenges. Despite the promise that data science approaches, including machine learning (ML), can accelerate the development of catalysts, truly novel catalysts have rarely been discovered through ML approaches because of one of its most common limitations and criticisms—the assumed inability to extrapolate and identify extraordinary materials. Herein, we demonstrate an extrapolative ML approach to develop new multi-elemental reverse water-gas shift catalysts. Using 45 catalysts as the initial data points and performing 44 cycles of the closed loop discovery system (ML prediction + experiment), we experimentally tested a total of 300 catalysts and identified more than 100 catalysts with superior activity compared to those of the previously reported high-performance catalysts. The composition of the optimal catalyst discovered was Pt(3)/Rb(1)-Ba(1)-Mo(0.6)-Nb(0.2)/TiO2. Notably, niobium (Nb) was not included in the original dataset, and the catalyst composition identified was not predictable even by human experts.

### 53. ChatGPT Chemistry Assistant for Text Mining and the Prediction of MOF Synthesis

**Authors:** Zhiling Zheng, Oufan Zhang, Christian Borgs, Jennifer T. Chayes, Omar M. Yaghi

**Venue:** Journal of the American Chemical Society

**Publication Date:** August 16, 2023

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 145, Issue 32

**Pages:** 18048-18062

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.3c05819

**Abstract:**
We use prompt engineering to guide ChatGPT in the automation of text mining of metal–organic framework (MOF) synthesis conditions from diverse formats and styles of the scientific literature. This effectively mitigates ChatGPT’s tendency to hallucinate information, an issue that previously made the use of large language models (LLMs) in scientific fields challenging. Our approach involves the development of a workflow implementing three different processes for text mining, programmed by ChatGPT itself. All of them enable parsing, searching, filtering, classification, summarization, and data unification with different trade-offs among labor, speed, and accuracy. We deploy this system to extract 26 257 distinct synthesis parameters pertaining to approximately 800 MOFs sourced from peer-reviewed research articles. This process incorporates our ChemPrompt Engineering strategy to instruct ChatGPT in text mining, resulting in impressive precision, recall, and F1 scores of 90–99%. Furthermore, with the data set built by text mining, we constructed a machine-learning model with over 87% accuracy in predicting MOF experimental crystallization outcomes and preliminarily identifying important factors in MOF crystallization. We also developed a reliable data-grounded MOF chatbot to answer questions about chemical reactions and synthesis procedures. Given that the process of using ChatGPT reliably mines and tabulates diverse MOF synthesis information in a unified format while using only narrative language requiring no coding expertise, we anticipate that our ChatGPT Chemistry Assistant will be very useful across various other chemistry subdisciplines.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 9, Issue 32

**Pages:** eadg7992

**DOI:** 10.1126/sciadv.adg7992

**Abstract:**
We propose strategies that couple natural language processing with deep learning to enhance machine capability for corrosion-resistant alloy design. First, accuracy of machine learning models for materials datasets is often limited by their inability to incorporate textual data. Manual extraction of numerical parameters from descriptions of alloy processing or experimental methodology inevitably leads to a reduction in information density. To overcome this, we have developed a fully automated natural language processing approach to transform textual data into a form compatible for feeding into a deep neural network. This approach has resulted in a pitting potential prediction accuracy substantially beyond state of the art. Second, we have implemented a deep learning model with a transformed-input feature space, consisting of a set of elemental physical/chemical property–based numerical descriptors of alloys replacing alloy compositions. This helped identification of those descriptors that are most critical toward enhancing their pitting potential. In particular, configurational entropy, atomic packing efficiency, local electronegativity differences, and atomic radii differences proved to be the most critical.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 14, Issue 1

**Pages:** 4607

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-023-40282-1

**Abstract:**
Porous carbons are the active materials of choice for supercapacitor applications because of their power capability, long-term cycle stability, and wide operating temperatures. However, the development of carbon active materials with improved physicochemical and electrochemical properties is generally carried out via time-consuming and cost-ineffective experimental processes. In this regard, machine-learning technology provides a data-driven approach to examine previously reported research works to find the critical features for developing ideal carbon materials for supercapacitors. Here, we report the design of a machine-learning-derived activation strategy that uses sodium amide and cross-linked polymer precursors to synthesize highly porous carbons (i.e., with specific surface areas > 4000 m2/g). Tuning the pore size and oxygen content of the carbonaceous materials, we report a highly porous carbon-base electrode with 0.7 mg/cm2 of electrode mass loading that exhibits a high specific capacitance of 610 F/g in 1 M H2SO4. This result approaches the specific capacitance of a porous carbon electrode predicted by the machine learning approach. We also investigate the charge storage mechanism and electrolyte transport properties via step potential electrochemical spectroscopy and quasielastic neutron scattering measurements.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s44160-022-00231-0

**Abstract:**
Accelerating the discovery of new molecules and materials, as well as developing green and sustainable ways to synthesize them, will help to address global challenges in energy, sustainability and healthcare. The recent growth of data science and automated experimentation techniques has resulted in the advent of self-driving labs (SDLs) via the integration of machine learning, lab automation and robotics. An SDL is a machine-learning-assisted modular experimental platform that iteratively operates a series of experiments selected by the machine learning algorithm to achieve a user-defined objective. These intelligent robotic assistants help researchers to accelerate the pace of fundamental and applied research through rapid exploration of the chemical space. In this Review, we introduce SDLs and provide a roadmap for their implementation by non-expert scientists. We present the status quo of successful SDL implementations in the field and discuss their current limitations and future opportunities to accelerate finding solutions for societal needs.

**Pages:** 1585-1603

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.matt.2023.03.009

**Abstract:**
High-throughput screening of hypothetical metal-organic framework (MOF) databases can uncover new materials, but their stability in real-world applications is often unknown. We leverage community knowledge and machine learning (ML) models to identify MOFs that are thermally stable and stable upon activation. We separate these MOFs into their building blocks and recombine them to make a new hypothetical MOF database of over 50,000 structures with orders of magnitude more (1) connectivity nets and (2) inorganic building blocks than were present in prior databases. This database shows a 10-fold enrichment of ultrastable MOF structures that are stable upon activation and more than 1 standard deviation more thermally stable than the average experimentally characterized MOF. For nearly 10,000 ultrastable MOFs, we compute elastic moduli to confirm that these materials have good mechanical stability, and we report methane deliverable capacities. We identify privileged metal nodes in ultrastable MOFs that optimize gas storage and mechanical stability simultaneously.

**Pages:** 292-298

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-023-05898-9

**Abstract:**
The development of new materials and their compositional and microstructural optimization are essential in regard to next-generation technologies such as clean energy and environmental sustainability. However, materials discovery and optimization have been a frustratingly slow process. The Edisonian trial-and-error process is time consuming and resource inefficient, particularly when contrasted with vast materials design spaces1. Whereas traditional combinatorial deposition methods can generate material libraries2,3, these suffer from limited material options and inability to leverage major breakthroughs in nanomaterial synthesis. Here we report a high-throughput combinatorial printing method capable of fabricating materials with compositional gradients at microscale spatial resolution. In situ mixing and printing in the aerosol phase allows instantaneous tuning of the mixing ratio of a broad range of materials on the fly, which is an important feature unobtainable in conventional multimaterials printing using feedstocks in liquid–liquid or solid–solid phases4–6. We demonstrate a variety of high-throughput printing strategies and applications in combinatorial doping, functional grading and chemical reaction, enabling materials exploration of doped chalcogenides and compositionally graded materials with gradient properties. The ability to combine the top-down design freedom of additive manufacturing with bottom-up control over local material compositions promises the development of compositionally complex materials inaccessible via conventional manufacturing approaches.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41524-023-01003-w

**Abstract:**
The ever-increasing number of materials science articles makes it hard to infer chemistry-structure-property relations from literature. We used natural language processing methods to automatically extract material property data from the abstracts of polymer literature. As a component of our pipeline, we trained MaterialsBERT, a language model, using 2.4 million materials science abstracts, which outperforms other baseline models in three out of five named entity recognition datasets. Using this pipeline, we obtained ~300,000 material property records from ~130,000 abstracts in 60 hours. The extracted data was analyzed for a diverse range of applications such as fuel cells, supercapacitors, and polymer solar cells to recover non-trivial insights. The data extracted through our pipeline is made available at polymerscholar.orgwhich can be used to locate material property data recorded in abstracts. This work demonstrates the feasibility of an automatic pipeline that starts from published literature and ends with extracted material property information.

**Abstract:**
Recent advances in machine learning have leveraged evolutionary information in multiple sequence alignments to predict protein structure. We demonstrate direct inference of full atomic-level protein structure from primary sequence using a large language model. As language models of protein sequences are scaled up to 15 billion parameters, an atomic-resolution picture of protein structure emerges in the learned representations. This results in an order-of-magnitude acceleration of high-resolution structure prediction, which enables large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins. We apply this capability to construct the ESM Metagenomic Atlas by predicting structures for >617 million metagenomic protein sequences, including >225 million that are predicted with high confidence, which gives a view into the vast breadth and diversity of natural proteins.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 15, Issue 1

**Pages:** 1871-1878

**DOI:** 10.1021/acsami.2c18167

**Abstract:**
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have intriguing physical and chemical properties, which exhibit promising applications in the fields of electronics, optoelectronics, as well as energy storage. However, the controllable synthesis of 2D materials is highly desirable but remains challenging. Machine learning (ML) facilitates the development of insights and discoveries from a large amount of data in a short time for the materials synthesis, which can significantly reduce the computational costs and shorten the development cycles. Based on this, taking the 2D material MoS2 as an example, the parameters of successfully synthesized materials by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) were explored through four ML algorithms: XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Recall, specificity, accuracy, and other metrics were used to assess the performance of these four models. By comparison, XGBoost was the best performing model among all the models, with an average prediction accuracy of over 88% and a high area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) reaching 0.91. And these findings showed that the reaction temperature (T) had a crucial influence on the growth of MoS2. Furthermore, the importance of the features in the growth mechanism of MoS2 was optimized, such as the reaction temperature (T), Ar gas flow rate (Rf), reaction time (t), and so on. The results demonstrated that ML assisted materials preparation can significantly minimize the time spent on exploration and trial-and-error, which provided perspectives in the preparation of 2D materials.

**Pages:** 1419-1425

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41563-022-01374-3

**Abstract:**
The heat capacity of a material is a fundamental property of great practical importance. For example, in a carbon capture process, the heat required to regenerate a solid sorbent is directly related to the heat capacity of the material. However, for most materials suitable for carbon capture applications, the heat capacity is not known, and thus the standard procedure is to assume the same value for all materials. In this work, we developed a machine learning approach, trained on density functional theory simulations, to accurately predict the heat capacity of these materials, that is, zeolites, metal–organic frameworks and covalent–organic frameworks. The accuracy of our prediction is confirmed with experimental data. Finally, for a temperature swing adsorption process that captures carbon from the flue gas of a coal-fired power plant, we show that for some materials, the heat requirement is reduced by as much as a factor of two using the correct heat capacity.

**DOI:** 10.1126/science.abo4940

**Abstract:**
High-entropy alloys are solid solutions of multiple principal elements that are capable of reaching composition and property regimes inaccessible for dilute materials. Discovering those with valuable properties, however, too often relies on serendipity, because thermodynamic alloy design rules alone often fail in high-dimensional composition spaces. We propose an active learning strategy to accelerate the design of high-entropy Invar alloys in a practically infinite compositional space based on very sparse data. Our approach works as a closed-loop, integrating machine learning with density-functional theory, thermodynamic calculations, and experiments. After processing and characterizing 17 new alloys out of millions of possible compositions, we identified two high-entropy Invar alloys with extremely low thermal expansion coefficients around 2 × 10−6 per degree kelvin at 300 kelvin. We believe this to be a suitable pathway for the fast and automated discovery of high-entropy alloys with optimal thermal, magnetic, and electrical properties.

**Pages:** eabn3103

**DOI:** 10.1126/science.abn3103

**Abstract:**
High-entropy nanoparticles have become a rapidly growing area of research in recent years. Because of their multielemental compositions and unique high-entropy mixing states (i.e., solid-solution) that can lead to tunable activity and enhanced stability, these nanoparticles have received notable attention for catalyst design and exploration. However, this strong potential is also accompanied by grand challenges originating from their vast compositional space and complex atomic structure, which hinder comprehensive exploration and fundamental understanding. Through a multidisciplinary view of synthesis, characterization, catalytic applications, high-throughput screening, and data-driven materials discovery, this review is dedicated to discussing the important progress of high-entropy nanoparticles and unveiling the critical needs for their future development for catalysis, energy, and sustainability applications.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 8, Issue 1

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41524-022-00729-3

**Abstract:**
The use of machine learning is becoming increasingly common in computational materials science. To build effective models of the chemistry of materials, useful machine-based representations of atoms and their compounds are required. We derive distributed representations of compounds from their chemical formulas only, via pooling operations of distributed representations of atoms. These compound representations are evaluated on ten different tasks, such as the prediction of formation energy and band gap, and are found to be competitive with existing benchmarks that make use of structure, and even superior in cases where only composition is available. Finally, we introduce an approach for learning distributed representations of atoms, named SkipAtom, which makes use of the growing information in materials structure databases.

**DOI:** 10.1021/jacs.1c06786

**Abstract:**
Reducing the lateral scale of two-dimensional (2D) materials to one-dimensional (1D) has attracted substantial research interest not only to achieve competitive electronic applications but also for the exploration of fundamental physical properties. Controllable synthesis of high-quality 1D nanoribbons (NRs) is thus highly desirable and essential for further study. Here, we report the implementation of supervised machine learning (ML) for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis of high-quality quasi-1D few-layered WTe2 NRs. Feature importance analysis indicates that H2 gas flow rate has a profound influence on the formation of WTe2, and the source ratio governs the sample morphology. Notably, the growth mechanism of 1T′ few-layered WTe2 NRs is further proposed, which provides new insights for the growth of intriguing 2D and 1D tellurides and may inspire the growth strategies for other 1D nanostructures. Our findings suggest the effectiveness and capability of ML in guiding the synthesis of 1D nanostructures, opening up new opportunities for intelligent materials development.

**Abstract:**
DeepMind presented notably accurate predictions at the recent 14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14) conference. We explored network architectures that incorporate related ideas and obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the one-dimensional (1D) sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.

**Pages:** 583-589

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2

**Abstract:**
Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.

**Abstract:**
Deep Learning (DL) methods are powerful analytical tools for microscopy and can outperform conventional image processing pipelines. Despite the enthusiasm and innovations fuelled by DL technology, the need to access powerful and compatible resources to train DL networks leads to an accessibility barrier that novice users often find difficult to overcome. Here, we present ZeroCostDL4Mic, an entry-level platform simplifying DL access by leveraging the free, cloud-based computational resources of Google Colab. ZeroCostDL4Mic allows researchers with no coding expertise to train and apply key DL networks to perform tasks including segmentation (using U-Net and StarDist), object detection (using YOLOv2), denoising (using CARE and Noise2Void), super-resolution microscopy (using Deep-STORM), and image-to-image translation (using Label-free prediction - fnet, pix2pix and CycleGAN). Importantly, we provide suitable quantitative tools for each network to evaluate model performance, allowing model optimisation. We demonstrate the application of the platform to study multiple biological processes.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-020-19597-w

**Abstract:**
Active learning—the field of machine learning (ML) dedicated to optimal experiment design—has played a part in science as far back as the 18th century when Laplace used it to guide his discovery of celestial mechanics. In this work, we focus a closed-loop, active learning-driven autonomous system on another major challenge, the discovery of advanced materials against the exceedingly complex synthesis-processes-structure-property landscape. We demonstrate an autonomous materials discovery methodology for functional inorganic compounds which allow scientists to fail smarter, learn faster, and spend less resources in their studies, while simultaneously improving trust in scientific results and machine learning tools. This robot science enables science-over-the-network, reducing the economic impact of scientists being physically separated from their labs. The real-time closed-loop, autonomous system for materials exploration and optimization (CAMEO) is implemented at the synchrotron beamline to accelerate the interconnected tasks of phase mapping and property optimization, with each cycle taking seconds to minutes. We also demonstrate an embodiment of human-machine interaction, where human-in-the-loop is called to play a contributing role within each cycle. This work has resulted in the discovery of a novel epitaxial nanocomposite phase-change memory material.

**Pages:** 4428

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-020-17112-9

**Abstract:**
Although machine learning (ML) models promise to substantially accelerate the discovery of novel materials, their performance is often still insufficient to draw reliable conclusions. Improved ML models are therefore actively researched, but their design is currently guided mainly by monitoring the average model test error. This can render different models indistinguishable although their performance differs substantially across materials, or it can make a model appear generally insufficient while it actually works well in specific sub-domains. Here, we present a method, based on subgroup discovery, for detecting domains of applicability (DA) of models within a materials class. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by analyzing three state-of-the-art ML models for predicting the formation energy of transparent conducting oxides. We find that, despite having a mutually indistinguishable and unsatisfactory average error, the models have DAs with distinctive features and notably improved performance.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-020-17263-9

**Abstract:**
Symbolic regression (SR) is an approach of interpretable machine learning for building mathematical formulas that best fit certain datasets. In this work, SR is used to guide the design of new oxide perovskite catalysts with improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities. A simple descriptor, μ/t, where μ and t are the octahedral and tolerance factors, respectively, is identified, which accelerates the discovery of a series of new oxide perovskite catalysts with improved OER activity. We successfully synthesise five new oxide perovskites and characterise their OER activities. Remarkably, four of them, Cs0.4La0.6Mn0.25Co0.75O3, Cs0.3La0.7NiO3, SrNi0.75Co0.25O3, and Sr0.25Ba0.75NiO3, are among the oxide perovskite catalysts with the highest intrinsic activities. Our results demonstrate the potential of SR for accelerating the data-driven design and discovery of new materials with improved properties.

**DOI:** 10.1002/adma.202000953

**Abstract:**
Advanced microscopy and/or spectroscopy tools play indispensable roles in nanoscience and nanotechnology research, as they provide rich information about material processes and properties. However, the interpretation of imaging data heavily relies on the “intuition” of experienced researchers. As a result, many of the deep graphical features obtained through these tools are often unused because of difficulties in processing the data and finding the correlations. Such challenges can be well addressed by deep learning. In this work, the optical characterization of 2D materials is used as a case study, and a neural-network-based algorithm is demonstrated for the material and thickness identification of 2D materials with high prediction accuracy and real-time processing capability. Further analysis shows that the trained network can extract deep graphical features such as contrast, color, edges, shapes, flake sizes, and their distributions, based on which an ensemble approach is developed to predict the most relevant physical properties of 2D materials. Finally, a transfer learning technique is applied to adapt the pretrained network to other optical identification applications. This artificial-intelligence-based material characterization approach is a powerful tool that would speed up the preparation, initial characterization of 2D materials and other nanomaterials, and potentially accelerate new material discoveries.

**DOI:** 10.1002/adma.202001626

**Abstract:**
The optimal synthesis of advanced nanomaterials with numerous reaction parameters, stages, and routes, poses one of the most complex challenges of modern colloidal science, and current strategies often fail to meet the demands of these combinatorially large systems. In response, an Artificial Chemist is presented: the integration of machine-learning-based experiment selection and high-efficiency autonomous flow chemistry. With the self-driving Artificial Chemist, made-to-measure inorganic perovskite quantum dots (QDs) in flow are autonomously synthesized, and their quantum yield and composition polydispersity at target bandgaps, spanning 1.9 to 2.9 eV, are simultaneously tuned. Utilizing the Artificial Chemist, eleven precision-tailored QD synthesis compositions are obtained without any prior knowledge, within 30 h, using less than 210 mL of total starting QD solutions, and without user selection of experiments. Using the knowledge generated from these studies, the Artificial Chemist is pre-trained to use a new batch of precursors and further accelerate the synthetic path discovery of QD compositions, by at least twofold. The knowledge-transfer strategy further enhances the optoelectronic properties of the in-flow synthesized QDs (within the same resources as the no-prior-knowledge experiments) and mitigates the issues of batch-to-batch precursor variability, resulting in QDs averaging within 1 meV from their target peak emission energy.

We report here a modular robotic platform driven by a model-based optimization algorithm capable of autonomously optimizing the optical and electronic properties of thin-film materials by modifying the film composition and processing conditions. We demonstrate the power of this platform by using it to maximize the hole mobility of organic hole transport materials commonly used in perovskite solar cells and consumer electronics. This demonstration highlights the possibilities of using autonomous laboratories to discover organic and inorganic materials relevant to materials sciences and clean energy technologies.

After giving basic notion of machine learning methods and principles, we describe examples of how statistical physics is used to understand methods in ML. We then move to describe applications of ML methods in particle physics and cosmology, quantum many body physics, quantum computing, and chemical and material physics. We also highlight research and development into novel computing architectures aimed at accelerating ML.

**Abstract:**
Data-driven science is heralded as a new paradigm in materials science. In this field, data is the new resource, and knowledge is extracted from materials datasets that are too big or complex for traditional human reasoning—typically with the intent to discover new or improved materials or materials phenomena. Multiple factors, including the open science movement, national funding, and progress in information technology, have fueled its development. Such related tools as materials databases, machine learning, and high-throughput methods are now established as parts of the materials research toolset. However, there are a variety of challenges that impede progress in data-driven materials science: data veracity, integration of experimental and computational data, data longevity, standardization, and the gap between industrial interests and academic efforts. In this perspective article, the historical development and current state of data-driven materials science, building from the early evolution of open science to the rapid expansion of materials data infrastructures are discussed. Key successes and challenges so far are also reviewed, providing a perspective on the future development of the field.

**Abstract:**
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been a hot research topic in the last decade, due to novel fundamental physics in the reduced dimension and appealing applications. Systematic discovery of functional 2D materials has been the focus of many studies. Here, we present a large dataset of 2D materials, with more than 6,000 monolayer structures, obtained from both top-down and bottom-up discovery procedures. First, we screened all bulk materials in the database of Materials Project for layered structures by a topology-based algorithm and theoretically exfoliated them into monolayers. Then, we generated new 2D materials by chemical substitution of elements in known 2D materials by others from the same group in the periodic table. The structural, electronic and energetic properties of these 2D materials are consistently calculated, to provide a starting point for further material screening, data mining, data analysis and artificial intelligence applications. We present the details of computational methodology, data record and technical validation of our publicly available data (http://www.2dmatpedia.org/).

**Abstract:**
We report a methodology using machine learning to capture chemical intuition from a set of (partially) failed attempts to synthesize a metal-organic framework. We define chemical intuition as the collection of unwritten guidelines used by synthetic chemists to find the right synthesis conditions. As (partially) failed experiments usually remain unreported, we have reconstructed a typical track of failed experiments in a successful search for finding the optimal synthesis conditions that yields HKUST-1 with the highest surface area reported to date. We illustrate the importance of quantifying this chemical intuition for the synthesis of novel materials.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41524-018-0129-0

**Abstract:**
Hetero-structures made from vertically stacked monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides hold great potential for optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. Discovery of the optimal layered material for specific applications necessitates the estimation of key material properties, such as electronic band structure and thermal transport coefficients. However, screening of material properties via brute force ab initio calculations of the entire material structure space exceeds the limits of current computing resources. Moreover, the functional dependence of material properties on the structures is often complicated, making simplistic statistical procedures for prediction difficult to employ without large amounts of data collection. Here, we present a Gaussian process regression model, which predicts material properties of an input hetero-structure, as well as an active learning model based on Bayesian optimization, which can efficiently discover the optimal hetero-structure using a minimal number of ab initio calculations. The electronic band gap, conduction/valence band dispersions, and thermoelectric performance are used as representative material properties for prediction and optimization. The Materials Project platform is used for electronic structure computation, while the BoltzTraP code is used to compute thermoelectric properties. Bayesian optimization is shown to significantly reduce the computational cost of discovering the optimal structure when compared with finding an optimal structure by building a regression model to predict material properties. The models can be used for predictions with respect to any material property and our software, including data preparation code based on the Python Materials Genomics (PyMatGen) library as well as python-based machine learning code, is available open source.

### 13. Deep neural networks for accurate predictions of crystal stability

**Authors:** Weike Ye, Chi Chen, Zhenbin Wang, Iek-Heng Chu, Shyue Ping Ong

**Venue:** Nature Communications

**Publication Date:** September 18, 2018

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 9, Issue 1

**Pages:** 3800

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-018-06322-x

**Abstract:**
Predicting the stability of crystals is one of the central problems in materials science. Today, density functional theory (DFT) calculations remain comparatively expensive and scale poorly with system size. Here we show that deep neural networks utilizing just two descriptors—the Pauling electronegativity and ionic radii—can predict the DFT formation energies of C3A2D3O12 garnets and ABO3 perovskites with low mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 7–10 meV atom−1 and 20–34 meV atom−1, respectively, well within the limits of DFT accuracy. Further extension to mixed garnets and perovskites with little loss in accuracy can be achieved using a binary encoding scheme, addressing a critical gap in the extension of machine-learning models from fixed stoichiometry crystals to infinite universe of mixed-species crystals. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of these models to rapidly transverse vast chemical spaces to accurately identify stable compositions, accelerating the discovery of novel materials with potentially superior properties.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-018-05761-w

**Abstract:**
Rapidly discovering functional materials remains an open challenge because the traditional trial-and-error methods are usually inefficient especially when thousands of candidates are treated. Here, we develop a target-driven method to predict undiscovered hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) for photovoltaics. This strategy, combining machine learning techniques and density functional theory calculations, aims to quickly screen the HOIPs based on bandgap and solve the problems of toxicity and poor environmental stability in HOIPs. Successfully, six orthorhombic lead-free HOIPs with proper bandgap for solar cells and room temperature thermal stability are screened out from 5158 unexplored HOIPs and two of them stand out with direct bandgaps in the visible region and excellent environmental stability. Essentially, a close structure-property relationship mapping the HOIPs bandgap is established. Our method can achieve high accuracy in a flash and be applicable to a broad class of functional material design.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 361, Issue 6400

**Pages:** 360-365

**DOI:** 10.1126/science.aat2663

**Abstract:**
The discovery of new materials can bring enormous societal and technological progress. In this context, exploring completely the large space of potential materials is computationally intractable. Here, we review methods for achieving inverse design, which aims to discover tailored materials from the starting point of a particular desired functionality. Recent advances from the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence, mostly from the subfield of machine learning, have resulted in a fertile exchange of ideas, where approaches to inverse molecular design are being proposed and employed at a rapid pace. Among these, deep generative models have been applied to numerous classes of materials: rational design of prospective drugs, synthetic routes to organic compounds, and optimization of photovoltaics and redox flow batteries, as well as a variety of other solid-state materials.

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 9, Issue 1

**Pages:** 2775

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-018-05169-6

**Abstract:**
Computational methods that automatically extract knowledge from data are critical for enabling data-driven materials science. A reliable identification of lattice symmetry is a crucial first step for materials characterization and analytics. Current methods require a user-specified threshold, and are unable to detect average symmetries for defective structures. Here, we propose a machine learning-based approach to automatically classify structures by crystal symmetry. First, we represent crystals by calculating a diffraction image, then construct a deep learning neural network model for classification. Our approach is able to correctly classify a dataset comprising more than 100,000 simulated crystal structures, including heavily defective ones. The internal operations of the neural network are unraveled through attentive response maps, demonstrating that it uses the same landmarks a materials scientist would use, although never explicitly instructed to do so. Our study paves the way for crystal structure recognition of—possibly noisy and incomplete—three-dimensional structural data in big-data materials science.

### 7. Accelerated discovery of metallic glasses through iteration of machine learning and high-throughput experiments

**Publication Date:** April 13, 2018

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 4, Issue 4

**Pages:** eaaq1566

**DOI:** 10.1126/sciadv.aaq1566

**Abstract:**
With more than a hundred elements in the periodic table, a large number of potential new materials exist to address the technological and societal challenges we face today; however, without some guidance, searching through this vast combinatorial space is frustratingly slow and expensive, especially for materials strongly influenced by processing. We train a machine learning (ML) model on previously reported observations, parameters from physiochemical theories, and make it synthesis method–dependent to guide high-throughput (HiTp) experiments to find a new system of metallic glasses in the Co-V-Zr ternary. Experimental observations are in good agreement with the predictions of the model, but there are quantitative discrepancies in the precise compositions predicted. We use these discrepancies to retrain the ML model. The refined model has significantly improved accuracy not only for the Co-V-Zr system but also across all other available validation data. We then use the refined model to guide the discovery of metallic glasses in two additional previously unreported ternaries. Although our approach of iterative use of ML and HiTp experiments has guided us to rapid discovery of three new glass-forming systems, it has also provided us with a quantitatively accurate, synthesis method–sensitive predictor for metallic glasses that improves performance with use and thus promises to greatly accelerate discovery of many new metallic glasses. We believe that this discovery paradigm is applicable to a wider range of materials and should prove equally powerful for other materials and properties that are synthesis path–dependent and that current physiochemical theories find challenging to predict.

**Pages:** 1702884

**DOI:** 10.1002/adma.201702884

**Abstract:**
A key challenge in guiding experiments toward materials with desired properties is to effectively navigate the vast search space comprising the chemistry and structure of allowed compounds. Here, it is shown how the use of machine learning coupled to optimization methods can accelerate the discovery of new Pb-free BaTiO3 (BTO-) based piezoelectrics with large electrostrains. By experimentally comparing several design strategies, it is shown that the approach balancing the trade-off between exploration (using uncertainties) and exploitation (using only model predictions) gives the optimal criterion leading to the synthesis of the piezoelectric (Ba0.84Ca0.16)(Ti0.90Zr0.07Sn0.03)O3 with the largest electrostrain of 0.23% in the BTO family. Using Landau theory and insights from density functional theory, it is uncovered that the observed large electrostrain is due to the presence of Sn, which allows for the ease of switching of tetragonal domains under an electric field.

### 4. Virtual screening of inorganic materials synthesis parameters with deep learning

**Authors:** Edward Kim, Kevin Huang, Stefanie Jegelka, Elsa Olivetti

**Venue:** npj Computational Materials

**Publication Date:** December 01, 2017

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 3, Issue 1

**Pages:** 53

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41524-017-0055-6

**Abstract:**
Virtual materials screening approaches have proliferated in the past decade, driven by rapid advances in first-principles computational techniques, and machine-learning algorithms. By comparison, computationally driven materials synthesis screening is still in its infancy, and is mired by the challenges of data sparsity and data scarcity: Synthesis routes exist in a sparse, high-dimensional parameter space that is difficult to optimize over directly, and, for some materials of interest, only scarce volumes of literature-reported syntheses are available. In this article, we present a framework for suggesting quantitative synthesis parameters and potential driving factors for synthesis outcomes. We use a variational autoencoder to compress sparse synthesis representations into a lower dimensional space, which is found to improve the performance of machine-learning tasks. To realize this screening framework even in cases where there are few literature data, we devise a novel data augmentation methodology that incorporates literature synthesis data from related materials systems. We apply this variational autoencoder framework to generate potential SrTiO3 synthesis parameter sets, propose driving factors for brookite TiO2 formation, and identify correlations between alkali-ion intercalation and MnO2 polymorph selection.

### 1. Accelerated search for materials with targeted properties by adaptive design

**Venue:** Nature Communications

**Publication Date:** April 15, 2016

**Volume & Issue:** Volume 7, Issue 1

**Pages:** 11241

**DOI:** 10.1038/ncomms11241

**Abstract:**
Finding new materials with targeted properties has traditionally been guided by intuition, and trial and error. With increasing chemical complexity, the combinatorial possibilities are too large for an Edisonian approach to be practical. Here we show how an adaptive design strategy, tightly coupled with experiments, can accelerate the discovery process by sequentially identifying the next experiments or calculations, to effectively navigate the complex search space. Our strategy uses inference and global optimization to balance the trade-off between exploitation and exploration of the search space. We demonstrate this by finding very low thermal hysteresis (ΔT) NiTi-based shape memory alloys, with Ti50.0Ni46.7Cu0.8Fe2.3Pd0.2 possessing the smallest ΔT (1.84 K). We synthesize and characterize 36 predicted compositions (9 feedback loops) from a potential space of ∼800,000 compositions. Of these, 14 had smaller ΔT than any of the 22 in the original data set.
